E.U. Starts Effort to Vaccinate 450 Million | BERLIN — From nursing homes in France to hospitals in Poland, older Europeans and the workers who care for them rolled up their sleeves on Sunday to receive coronavirus vaccine shots in a campaign to inoculate more than 450 million people across the European Union. The inoculations offered a rare respite as the continent struggles with one of its most precarious moments since the pandemic began. Despite national lockdowns, restrictions on movement, shuttering of restaurants and cancellations of Christmas gatherings, the virus has stalked Europe into the dark winter months. The spread of a more contagious variant of the virus in Britain has raised such alarm that much of continental Europe rushed to close its borders to travelers coming from the country, effectively plunging the nation as a whole into quarantine. “Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year,” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president wrote on Twitter. “The #COVID19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries.” For Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, the vaccine’s arrival could not come soon enough. Italy’s suffering at the outset of the pandemic served as a warning for the world, and the current death toll is again among the worst in Europe. “Today Italy reawakens. It’s #VaccineDay,” he wrote on Twitter after a 29-year-old nurse at Rome’s Spallanzani hospital was the first person to be inoculated. “This date will remain with us forever.” The nurse, Claudia Alivernini, said she hoped the vaccination campaign would signal “the beginning of the end” of the pandemic. In Spain, a 96-year-old great-grandmother, Araceli Rosario Hidalgo, was the first to receive the vaccine. The Los Olmos nursing home, where she lives, is in Guadalajara, a city that has a special storage facility where the first doses of the vaccine were delivered on Saturday, transported from Belgium. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wrote on Twitter that the vaccinations marked “a hopeful new chapter.” Similar scenes played out across the continent, although not every member of the bloc followed the rollout plans. In Germany, a nursing home in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt jumped the gun, inoculating dozens of residents and staff members on Saturday, hours after the doses arrived. Officials in the Netherlands said they planned to begin vaccinations on Jan. 8. But all E.U. member nations now have a supply of vaccine on hand to distribute. Early Sunday, dozens of minivans carrying coolers filled with dry ice to keep the doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from rising above minus 70 degrees Celsius fanned out to nursing homes across the German capital. The rollout comes as Europe’s largest nation is confronting its deadliest period since the start of the pandemic. With nearly 1,000 deaths recorded in Germany each day in the week before Christmas, a crematory in the eastern state of Saxony operated around the clock, straight through the holiday, to keep up. “I’ve never had to see it this bad before,” said Eveline Müller, the director of the facility, in the town of Görlitz. More than 350,000 people in the 27 nations that make up the European Union have died from Covid-19 since the bloc’s first fatality was recorded in France on Feb. 15. And for many countries, the worst days have come in recent weeks. In Poland, November was the deadliest month since the end of World War II. The European Union’s member states made a show of solidarity by waiting for the bloc’s regulatory board to approve the vaccine before beginning coordinated national campaigns. But how those will play out in individual countries is likely to be disparate. All of the member states have national health care systems, so people will be vaccinated free of charge. But just as hospitals in poorer member states like Bulgaria and Romania were overwhelmed in the latest wave of the virus, the networks in those countries will face challenges in distributing vaccines. While each nation is determining how to carry out its campaign, in general the first phase will focus on people most at risk of exposure and those most likely to have serious health conditions — health care workers and the oldest citizens. Most member states have said they expect the vaccine to reach the general public by spring. As Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece got his shot on Sunday, he encouraged citizens to get one, too. “It’s the only way to take back control of our lives, to hug the people that we love,” he said.
2020 Take: Covid-19 Unravelled Gujarat's Industries, Migrants' March Induced Tears; Lions Roared Loud | Disruption of industrial activities due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, protests by jobless migrants eager to return home and hospital fires - all these and more kept Gujarat in the news during the year. Near-deserted roads, closed factories, business establishments and educational institutions defined life in the early months of the lockdown in the state. Public mask mandate, social distancing, hand hygiene, work from home and online education became buzzwords as people digested the magnitude of the global health crisis. The lockdown turned into a human tragedy in Gujarat as migrant labourers, rendered jobless and left with very little resources to fall back on, decided to leave for their native places. The restless migrant workers hit the streets to demand transport arrangements to travel back to their hometowns during the lockdown. These protests took violent turn in some cities. There were painful scenes of migrant workers returning to their home states by whatever means of transport they got. While some just walked towards their native places, others used cycles or any other vehicle available to make the return journey. The government later started special trains to ferry migrant workers to their respective states. Some patients were burnt alive in fire incidents while being treated at Gujarat's COVID-19 designated hospitals. For coronavirus patients in the ICU of Ahmedabad's Shrey Hospital, the intervening night of August 5 and 6 proved devastating. Eight patients perished in the massive fire at the hospital. On November 26 and 27 night, five COVID-19 patients died in a blaze in the ICU of a private hospital in Rajkot. A fire broke out at SSG Hospitals ICU in Vadodara but patients were saved as they were evacuated in time.

On November 26 and 27 night, five COVID-19 patients died in a blaze in the ICU of a private hospital in Rajkot. A fire broke out at SSG Hospitals ICU in Vadodara but patients were saved as they were evacuated in time. State authorities moved to ramp up testing labs, earmarked beds in hospitals for COVID-19 patients and set up quarantine facilities to deal with the rising cases. As the march of the coronavirus slowed down life, gritty tales of health professionals and frontline workers helping the fight against the infection came to light. The pandemic took a toll on the economy of Gujarat, one of the most industrialised states, social life and even affected the mental health of some people. The first case of coronavirus was reported in Gujarat on March 19 and the maiden death registered on March 22. Since then the health authorities have been dealing with increasing caseloads and deaths from across the state. Life started coming back on track after the unlocking process began and economic activities resumed. However, a second wave of COVID-19, which started after the festive season ended in mid-November, prompted the state government to introduce a night curfew in four major cities - Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat, died on November 25 due to complications related to COVID-19. Newly-elected BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat Abhay Bharadwaj died on December 2 due while undergoing treatment for COVID-19 complications. Former Gujarat chief minister Keshubhai Patel died on October 29 due to post-COVID-19 health-related issues, while Gujarati film actor Naresh Kanodia died while undergoing treatment for the viral infection. Former Union minister Bharatsinh Solanki survived the coronavirus after a struggle of 102 days in a hospital, while a 59-year-old man from Dholka town in Ahmedabad district defeated the virus after spending 113 days in a hospital. During his visits to his home state over the last two months, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched many projects including a sea-plane service, ro-pax ferry service and a ropeway in Gujarat. He also laid foundation stones for a mega hybrid energy park in Kutch district and desalination plants in the state. The BJP won all the eight Assembly seats where bypolls were held in November, boosting the stature of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. These seats fell vacant after sitting Congress MLAs resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls in June, paving the way for the BJP's victory on three of the four RS seats. The BJP's clean sweep in the Assembly bypolls raised question marks over the organisational strength of the state Congress, out of power in Gujarat for over two decades now. In news that brought cheers to wildlife lovers, the Gujarat forest department, after an estimation exercise in June, said the number of lions in Gir forests has increased from 523 in 2015 to 674 in 2020. The department did not carry out a full census this time due to the coronavirus pandemic. Decommissioned aircraft carrier INS Viraat is awaiting dismantling at the Alang ship breaking yard in Gujarat after hopes of converting the iconic ship into a museum faded. During the year, Gujarat saw two major industrial accidents in which 20 people died. In January, eight people were killed in a blast at an industrial and medical gas manufacturing company in Vadodara district, while on November 4, a powerful blast rocked a chemical storage unit in Ahmedabad, killing 12 people. Five Pakistanis allegedly trying to smuggle in drugs worth Rs 175 crore were apprehended on a fishing boat off the Gujarat coast in January by the Coast Guard.
India's Covid-19 tally climbs to 1.02 cr with 20,021 new cases; active cases drop to 2.77 lakh | India's daily number of coronavirus cases on Monday stood at 20,021. Up to 279 fresh fatalities were recorded in a span of 24 hours, pushing the overall death toll since the outbreak in January to 1,47,901. The country's overall positive Covid-19 cases stood at 1,02,07,871, with 2,77,301 active cases. The national capital recorded just 757 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, bringing much-needed relief to the Delhiites who have seen a sharp spike in cases in November. The total recovered coronavirus cases in the country stood at 97,82,669 with 21,131 new discharges in the last 24 hours. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday said 7,15,397 samples have been tested for coronavirus yesterday. The total number of samples tested so far in India are 16,88,18,054, the top medical body stated. India on Sunday recorded 18,732 fresh infections, the lowest since 1 July, when 18,653 cases were recorded. Meanwhile, the coronavirus caseload in the United States has surpassed 19 million, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University. As of 01:23 IST on Monday, Johns Hopkins University had registered 19,069,926 positive tests for the coronavirus infection in America. India's national coronavirus task force met recently amid the new mutant strain scare that has been traced in the United Kingdom and discussed surveillance strategies. More than 50 samples of people who have returned to India from the UK are currently being sequenced at six labs across the country to find out if they have the mutant strain. District surveillance officers are identifying passengers who have arrived from the UK in the past one month, as per reports. As the Covid-19 pandemic has paralysed economies, devastated communities and confined almost four billion people to their homes, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that the coronavirus crisis will not be the last pandemic, and attempts to improve human health are "doomed" without tackling climate change and animal welfare. In a video message marking Sunday's first International Day of Epidemic Preparedness, the WHO chief condemned the "dangerously short-sighted" cycle of throwing cash at outbreaks but doing nothing to prepare for the next one.
Thailand tracks 127 contacts of new Covid-19 case | BANGKOK (THE NATION/ASIA NEWS NETWORK, XINHUA) - Thailand has found a new case of Covid-19 since mass infections were reported in Samut Sakhon province earlier this month and in Rayong province a few days ago. The patient is a 46-year-old woman, a resident of Rayong's Muang district - south of Bangkok - who had arrived in the northern city of Chiang Mai on Dec 26. "She showed symptoms, such as dryness in the throat and 37.4 degrees (Celsius) temperature and received testing on December 27. She was found positive," said Dr Kittiphan Chalom, Chiang Mai's public health deputy chief, during an emergency meeting on Sunday (Dec 28). Dr Kittiphan added that the woman is now being treated in a negative pressure room at Nakornping Hospital in Mae Rim district in Chiang Mai. "This is considered an imported case from another province. There is still no local outbreak within Chiang Mai at the moment," he said. According to Dr Kittiphan, preliminary tracing of the patient's travel history revealed that she had visited a fitness centre in Rayong province on Dec 24 and had close contact with a trainer who was later confirmed as infected. On Dec 26, she travelled from U-Tapao Airport to Chiang Mai International Airport on Thai AirAsia flight FD101, seat 22C, with her husband, her two children and a babysitter. "In total, 127 persons have been found to have had contact with her and carry a risk of infection, 30 of whom carry high risk that health officials had already contacted them to collect samples for testing," said Dr Kittiphan. "The rest 97 persons were told to stay in self-quarantine to monitor their symptoms for 14 days." Thailand on Sunday recorded 121 new cases of Covid-19 infections. The new cases included 94 local infections, 18 Myanmar migrant workers in Samut Sakhon, a province near Bangkok where a cluster was discovered last week, and nine imported cases. Rayong province has also been officially declared a zone under maximum control, following the reported infections of 36 people, 29 of whom were allegedly involved in illegal gambling activity in the downtown area. The provincial governor of Rayong will soon decide whether lockdown measures will be enforced in all or in part of the eastern province, he said. Thailand has confirmed 6,141 Covid-19 cases so far. A total of 4,161 have fully recovered and been discharged from hospitals while 1,920 others are currently being hospitalised. The country has reported 60 fatalities from the coronavirus.
Highlights of COVID-19, government funding law taking effect | An employee of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, receives one of the first COVID-19 vaccines at the medical center, Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020. Wake Forest Baptist received its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Monday morning. Ten employees received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine Tuesday. Additional employees will be given the vaccine in the coming days. (Walt Unks/The Winston-Salem Journal via AP)(Walt Unks/The Winston-Salem Journal via AP) (AP) - The massive, year-end catchall bill that President Donald Trump signed into law combines $900 billion in COVID-19 aid with a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill and reams of other unfinished legislation on taxes, energy, education and health care. Highlights of the measure with overall funding amounts and specific amounts for some but not necessarily all initiatives. Unemployment insurance ($120 billion). Revives supplemental federal pandemic unemployment benefits but at $300 per week — through March 14 — instead of the $600 per week benefit that expired in July. Extends special pandemic benefits for “gig” workers and extends the maximum period for state-paid jobless benefits to 50 weeks. Direct payments ($166 billion). Provides $600 direct payments to individuals making up to $75,000 per year and couples making up to $150,000 per year — with payments phased out for higher incomes —- with $600 additional payments per dependent child. Paycheck Protection Program ($284 billion). Revives the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to qualified businesses. Especially hard-hit businesses that received PPP grants would be eligible for a second round. Ensures that PPP subsidies are not taxed. Vaccines, testing, health providers ($69 billion). Delivers more than $30 billion for procurement of vaccines and treatments, distribution funds for states, and a strategic stockpile. Adds $22 billion for testing, tracing and mitigation, $9 billion for health care providers, and $4.5 billion for mental health. Schools and universities ($82 billion). Delivers $54 billion to public K-12 schools affected by the pandemic and $23 billion for colleges and universities; $4 billion would be awarded to a Governors Emergency Education Relief Fund; nearly $1 billion for Native American schools. Rental assistance ($25 billion). Provides money for a first-ever federal rental assistance program; funds to be distributed by state and local governments to help people who have fallen behind on their rent and may be facing eviction. Food/farm aid ($26 billion). Increases stamp benefits by 15% for six months and provides funding to food banks, Meals on Wheels and other food aid. Provides an equal amount ($13 billion) to farmers and ranchers. Child Care ($10 billion). Provides $10 billion to the Child Care Development Block Grant to help families with child care costs and help providers cover increased operating costs. Postal Service ($10 billion). Forgives a $10 billion loan to the Postal Service provided in earlier relief legislation. The omnibus measure wraps 12 spending bills into one and funds agency operating budgets through Sept. 30 of next year. It combines Democratic priorities such as a $12.5 billion increase over existing budget limits for domestic programs while cutting Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention and removal costs by $431 million. COVID-19 has contributed to sharply lower costs. Republicans supported sustained defense spending, energy provisions and longstanding bans on federal funding of abortion. The measure also provides President Donald Trump with a last, $1.4 billion installment for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The measure also contains more than 3,000 pages of miscellaneous legislation, such as: Surprise medical billing. Includes bipartisan legislation to protect consumers from huge surprise medical bills after receiving treatment from out-of-network providers. Community health centers. Reauthorizes, for three years, funding for community health centers and extends a variety of expiring health care policies, including reimbursement rates for various health care providers and procedures under Medicare and Medicaid Tax extenders. Extends a variety of expiring tax breaks, including lower excise taxes on craft brewers and distillers. Renewable energy sources would see tax breaks extended, as would motorsport facilities, and people making charitable contributions. Business meals would be 100% deductible through 2022 and out-of-pocket health care costs would be deductible after they reach 7.5% of income. It would also extend favorable tax treatment for “look through” entities of offshore subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Water projects. Includes an almost 400-page water resources bill that targets $10 billion for 46 Army Corps of Engineers flood control, environmental and coastal protection projects. Clean energy. Boosts “clean energy” programs like research and development, efficiency incentives and tax credits. Phases out “superpollutant” hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Education. Includes a bipartisan agreement to forgive about $1.3 billion in federal loans to historically Black colleges and universities and simplify college financial aid forms. Boosts the maximum Pell Grant for low-income college students by $150 to $6,495. Offers “second chance” Pell Grants to incarcerated prisoners. Horse racing “doping.” Adds bipartisan legislation by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to create national medication and safety standards for the horse racing industry as lawmakers move to clamp down on the use of performance-enhancing drugs that can lead to horse injuries and deaths. New Smithsonian museums. Establishes the Women’s History Museum and the National Museum of the American Latino as new Smithsonian museums located near the National Mall. Pipeline safety. Folds in pipeline safety legislation reauthorizing operating grants and safety standards for oil and gas pipelines. Aircraft safety. Adds, after the scandal involving Boeing 737 MAX crashes, legislation to beef up the Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft certification process. Addresses human factors, automation in the cockpit, and international pilot training while authorizing nearly $275 million over the next five years to carry out the legislation.
Lee County COVID-19 vaccinations begin Monday for people 65 and older | Starting Monday, the Florida Department of Health in Lee County will begin COVID-19 vaccinations for high-risk frontline health care workers and those 65 and older. DOH-Lee staff will have 300 doses of vaccine available at each site, supported by Lee County Public Safety. The first of seven testing sites will be at Estero Park and Recreation Center. Those who stopped by the Etero site say this could be the first step to getting back to pre-pandemic normalcy. Monday’s vaccination opportunity represents hope for Deane and Dick Hall of Bonita Springs. “We’re excited to get the vaccination and we can’t wait to get it,” Deane said. After months of not being able to hug their grandkids, there’s finally a light at the end of the tunnel. “I’d like to put COVID 2020 to bed and go on with a better year,” Dick said. That ray of light comes in the form of the Estero Parks and Rec Center where high-risk frontline health care workers and those 65 and older can get the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Karlene Reilly is from Estero and sees this opportunity for a vaccine as thrilling. “Absolutely thrilled that there is a possibility. It’s really an answer to a prayer. and I hope that I am able to get it,” Reilly said. She came to the center to see if she could find out more information about what to do prior to getting in line. There, she learned that there is a release form to fill out. “I’ve been trying to be as careful as I can be but I think I would feel better if I had the vaccine in my system,” said Reilly. 2020 has been challenging and worrisome for many but they think the vaccine is a good way to ring in a new year. “It’s the beginning of the new year,” said Dick. “Let’s hope we can all get it very quickly,” Reilly said. The Moderna vaccine does require two doses which are meant to be given 28 days apart. WINK News reached out to the Department of Health about getting the second dose if you happen to get the first one but they have not yet responded.
Donald Trump signs Covid-19 relief and spending bill | Donald Trump has signed the Covid-19 relief and spending bill after days of delays, preventing a mid-pandemic government shutdown. The announcement on Sunday night after Republicans urged him to act following his refusal to sign the bill, a decision that meant millions of Americans lost unemployment aid. Trump blindsided members of both parties and upended months of negotiations when he demanded last week that the package – already passed by the House and Senate by large margins and believed to have Trump’s support – be revised to include larger relief checks and scaled-back spending. But on Sunday night Trump released a statement that he had signed the bill, saying it was his “responsibility to protect the people of our country from the economic devastation and hardship” caused by coronavirus. “As president, I have told Congress that I want far less wasteful spending and more money going to the American people in the form of $2,000 checks per adult and $600 per child. “I am signing this bill to restore unemployment benefits, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, add money for PPP, return our airline workers back to work, add substantially more money for vaccine distribution, and much more.” He ended the statement by saying “Much more money is coming,” although he provided nothing to back this promise. Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, welcomed the move. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed Trump’s signing as a “down payment on what is needed” saying: “Now, the president must immediately call on congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000.” Shares in Asia ticked upwards on news that Trump had signed the bill, and US stock futures rose 0.4%. In the face of growing economic hardship and spreading disease, lawmakers had urged Trump on Sunday to sign the legislation immediately, then have Congress follow up with additional aid. Aside from unemployment benefits and relief payments to families, money for vaccine distribution, businesses, and cash-starved public transit systems is on the line. Protections against evictions also hang in the balance. It was not immediately clear why Trump changed his mind as his resistance to the massive legislative package promised a chaotic final stretch of his presidency. White House officials have been tight-lipped about Trump’s thinking but a source familiar with the situation cited by Reuters said that some advisers had urged him to relent because they did not see the point of refusing. Republican officials were relieved that Trump had backed away from his veiled veto threat, saying it should help Republican Senate candidates David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in the Georgia runoff elections on 5 January that will determine control of the Senate. Earlier on Sunday, Republican senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said he understood that Trump “wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire”. Toomey added: “So I think the best thing to do, as I said, sign this and then make the case for subsequent legislation.” The same point was echoed by Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has criticised Trump’s pandemic response and his efforts to undo the election results. “I just gave up guessing what he might do next,” he said. Republican representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said too much was at stake for Trump to “play this old switcheroo game”. “I don’t get the point,” he said. “I don’t understand what’s being done, why, unless it’s just to create chaos and show power and be upset because you lost the election.” Washington has been reeling since Trump turned on the deal, without warning, after it had won sweeping approval in both houses of Congress and after the White House had assured Republican leaders that Trump would support it. The bill had lain unsigned on his desk since Christmas Day as the president, who was mostly silent through weeks of intense negotiations, spent the weekend at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach. Instead, he assailed the bill’s plan to provide $600 Covid-19 relief checks to most Americans – insisting it should be $2,000 – and took issue with spending included in an attached $1.4 trillion government funding bill to keep the federal government operating through September. And already, his opposition has had consequences, as two federal programs providing unemployment aid expired on Saturday. Lauren Bauer of the Brookings Institution had calculated that at least 11 million people would lose aid immediately as a result of Trump’s failure to sign the legislation; millions more would exhaust other unemployment benefits within weeks. How and when people are affected by the lapse depends on the state they live in, the program they are relying on and when they applied for benefits. In some states, people on regular unemployment insurance will continue to receive payments under a program that extends benefits when the jobless rate surpassed a certain threshold, said Andrew Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert and senior fellow at the Century Foundation think tank. About 9.5 million people, however, had been relying on the pandemic unemployment assistance program that expired altogether Saturday. That program made unemployment insurance available to freelancers, gig workers and others normally not eligible. After receiving their last checks, those recipients will not be able to file for more aid, Stettner said. Joe Biden, who won November’s presidential election and who will be sworn in as Trump’s successor on 20 January, accused him of an “abdication of responsibility” in a statement on Saturday. The relief bill wrangles come as the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the US, with medical experts joining Biden in predicting that the darkest days lay ahead. “We very well might see a post-seasonal, in the sense of Christmas, New Year, surge,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the US head of infectious diseases, told CNN on Sunday.
US surpasses 19m Covid-19 cases: Johns Hopkins University | WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States surpassed 19 million coronavirus cases Sunday (Dec 27), figures from Johns Hopkins University showed, adding one million new cases in less than a week. The US recorded 165,151 new cases in 24 hours at 8:30 pm (0130 GMT Monday), the Baltimore-based institution said, bringing the overall total to 19,107,675 cases. The grim new milestone comes just six days after the US crossed the 18 million case threshold. The US also has a total of 333,069 virus-related deaths. Both the caseload and death toll are by far the highest in the world. Coronavirus cases have been surging at an alarming rate in the US in recent months. The world's largest economy has added at least one million new cases per week since early November, according to an AFP tally of Johns Hopkins data. And on Saturday, Johns Hopkins calculated that one in 1,000 Americans have died of Covid-19. More than a million Americans have received the first dose of their Covid-19 vaccines, a milestone in the biggest immunization drive in US history, but officials admitted the pace of rollout was slipping behind schedule. Additionally, the vaccines will not help the current surge in cases. Top US government scientist Anthony Fauci warned earlier Sunday that the worst of the pandemic may be yet to come, driving the country to a "critical point" as holiday travel spreads the coronavirus.
Trump signs COVID-19 pandemic aid and spending Bill, averting government shutdown | WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday (Dec 28) signed into law a US$2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package, restoring unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and averting a federal government shutdown in a crisis of his own making. Trump, who leaves office on Jan 20 after losing November's election, backed down from his threat to block the Bill, which was approved by Congress last week, after he came under intense pressure from lawmakers on both sides. The Republican president, who golfed on Sunday and remained out of public view even as the potential government shutdown loomed, had demanded that Congress change the Bill to increase the size of stimulus checks for struggling Americans to US$2,000 from US$600. It was not immediately clear why Trump changed his mind as his resistance to the massive legislative package promised a chaotic final stretch of his presidency. White House officials have been tight-lipped about Trump's thinking but a source familiar with the situation said some advisers had urged him to relent because they did not see the point of refusing. "Good news on Covid Relief Bill. Information to follow!" Trump said in a cryptic message on Twitter earlier on Sunday evening. But he offered no explanation. Democrats are on board with the US$2,000 payments but many Republicans have opposed it in the past. Many economists agree the financial aid in the Bill should be higher to get the economy moving again but say that immediate support for Americans hit by COVID-19 lockdowns is still urgently needed. Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million people through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but will be restarted now that Trump has signed the Bill. The package includes US$1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies. If Trump had not signed the legislation, then a partial government shutdown would have begun on Tuesday that would have put millions of government workers' incomes at risk. Global share prices ticked up in response to the news that Trump had passed the stimulus plan and backed away from a government spending crisis. US S&P futures and Japan's Nikkei index gained around 0.4 per cent, and spot gold prices rose nearly 1 per cent.  "It is positive for markets that we no longer have a chaos over stimulus, considering there was a chance of a partial government shutdown," said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief strategist at Sumimoto Mitsui DS Asset Management. Trump’s abrupt move to sign the Bill came after most Republican lawmakers refused to back his call for changes to legislation they had already voted on. Hours earlier, Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told Fox News Sunday Trump wants "to be remembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire". Republican officials were relieved that Trump had backed away from his veiled veto threat, saying it should help Republican Senate candidates David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in Jan 5 runoff elections that will determine control of the US Senate. Trump sought to put the best face on his climb-down, saying he was signing the Bill with "a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed". He noted that Democratic-controlled House of Representatives planned to vote on Monday to increase coronavirus relief checks to individuals from US$600 to US$2,000, and said the Senate "will start the process" to approve higher payments. US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Republican, said "I thank the President for signing this relief into law" but made no mention of any plans for a Senate vote. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed Trump's signing as a "down payment on what is needed", saying: "Now, the President must immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to US$2,000." After months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he later said he was unhappy with the massive Bill, which provides US$892 billion in COVID-19 financial relief. Trump spent the Christmas holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. On Sunday morning, he seemed in no rush to try to resolve the standoff with Congress as he played a round of golf at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. He had also complained that the Bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid. In his signing statement, Trump also sought to keep alive his campaign of baseless claims that the November election was rigged against him. He said the House and Senate "have agreed to focus strongly on the very substantial voter fraud" and that the Senate will launch an investigation. Neither McConnell nor Pelosi made mention of such an agreement. Democratic lawmakers have steadfastly rejected Trump's claims as have some Republicans. McConnell angered Trump by recognising Biden as president-elect. Americans are living through a bitter holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000 people, the highest since the pandemic began. The relief package also extends a moratorium on evictions that was due to expire on Dec 31, refreshes support for small business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution. 
Fu Yu Corp a ‘stable dividend dispenser’ despite Covid-19: RHB | Despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, RHB Securities has remained bullish on Fu Yu Corp as a “stable dividend dispenser”. The brokerage expects the precision plastic components manufacturer to make a 1.7 cents payout for FY20, which translates to an “attractive” yield of 6.3%. This comes as Fu Yu has a strong net cash position of $97.8 million and zero borrowings, it notes. “Despite a blip in FY20 caused by the Covid-19 situation, we believe Fu Yu – with a strong net cash balance sheet – will [be] able to weather the storm,” RHB head of research Jarick Seet writes in a noted dated Dec 28. “We also think that it can at the same time provide its investors with attractive dividends despite an estimated temporary drop in profits for FY20,” he adds.  RHB has maintained its “buy” rating for the stock with an unchanged target price of 30 cents. As at 10.42 am, Fu Yu was flat at 25.5 cents with 11,800 shares changed hands.
5 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, including 1 in community | SINGAPORE: Five new COVID-19 cases were reported in Singapore as of noon on Monday (Dec 28), said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its daily preliminary update. Of the new cases, one is in the community. It is the first community case in the country since Dec 21. Four of the new cases were imported. All four cases were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon their arrival in Singapore. Details of the new cases will be released on Monday night, said the health ministry. Singapore entered Phase 3 of its reopening on Monday. Social gatherings of up to eight people will be allowed in public, up from five currently. Similarly, households can receive up to eight visitors. Worship services are now allowed to have up to 250 people, and capacity limits in public places such as malls and attractions have been increased as well. The Government will begin vaccinating healthcare workers from Dec 30, beginning with those at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), said MOH on Sunday. Vaccinations will subsequently be rolled out to more healthcare institutions. This will be followed by vaccinations for the elderly, starting with those aged 70 years and above, from February.  "Thereafter we will vaccinate other Singaporeans and long-term residents who are medically eligible for vaccination. More details will be shared in due course," said MOH.  The vaccine will be free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents, including long-term work permit holders. As of Monday, Singapore has reported a total of 58,529 COVID-19 cases.

COVID-19: Hawker centre seat markings revised, restrictions at some markets to be removed in Phase 3 | SINGAPORE: Hawker centres and markets across Singapore will see safe management measures adjusted in Phase 3 of Singapore’s reopening. The National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Monday (Dec 28) that seat markings have been revised at the dining areas of hawker centres to accommodate the increase in group sizes of up to eight people. Additionally, more markets will see access control and interim fencing removed. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, NEA, NEA-appointed operators and town councils have marked out seats and tables at dining areas of hawker centres in accordance with safe distancing guidelines. With Phase 3, markings on seats and tables at the dining areas of hawker centres have been revised to accommodate the increase in dining group size from five to eight people. In general, tables with eight seats or fewer will no longer have any seat markings. Tables with more than eight seats will still have some seats marked out to ensure that dining groups remain limited to eight people and that there is a one-metre safe distance between groups. "In addition, where seats at adjacent tables (eg back-to-back) are less than 1m apart, some seats may also be marked out to maintain a safe distance between dining groups at different tables," said NEA. Safe distancing ambassadors will continue to be deployed at hawker centres to ensure compliance with safe management measures. "Besides keeping to safe management measures, patrons should also continue to bin their litter, such as used disposables, tissues and wet wipes, and return crockery and trays to designated collection points," said NEA. "This will help to keep the dining environment at our hawker centres clean, and reduce the risk of disease transmission to other patrons, cleaners and hawkers." Access control and interim fencing were implemented from April at 40 crowded markets to prevent patrons from entering once the number of patrons in each market reached the allowed capacity. Since then, NEA has progressively removed interim fencing at a total of 20 markets in two separate reviews in June and November. There are currently 81 markets managed by NEA and NEA-appointed operators.
Malaysia's asymptomatic Covid-19 patients to isolate at home first as worker cases surge | KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia is advising people who have tested positive for the coronavirus but have no Covid-19 symptoms to self-isolate at home first, as cases involving foreign workers are surging. These asymptomatic patients should keep in contact with their district health offices. The Health Ministry's director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said these patients may not be taken to hospitals immediately, as the healthcare system is overloaded, Malay Mail online news reported him as saying on Monday (Dec 28). Malaysia is grappling with logistical issues such as the ferrying of people to hospitals and a high number of foreign workers being tested and found to have Covid-19. "We are talking about more than 1,000 cases a day. This is because of increased testing among foreign workers, and as expected more cases being diagnosed," Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham said, as quoted by Malay Mail. "Foreign workers have no place to be isolated in... We have thousands here. We are increasing the number of (hospital) beds to 10,000." Malaysia has stepped up the testing of foreign workers for Covid-19. Enforcement on the mandatory Covid-19 screening for foreign workers will start from Jan 1 - only for the six high-risk states and federal territories, said Human Resources Minister M. Saravanan, The Star daily reported. These state comprise Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Penang and Sabah, along with the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Labuan, involving some 800,000 foreign workers. For other states, mass testing on foreign workers will start after February next year. Datuk Seri Saravanan said that as at Sunday, a total of 68,460 foreign workers had been screened, involving 2,385 employers, according to The Star. The authorities have been intensely checking on foreign-worker accommodation in the last few weeks and issuing fines on companies including glovemakers for housing the migrants in cramped and poor conditions, that have partly caused the spread of Covid-19. Malaysia recorded 1,196 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, according to Malay Mail. It currently has 20,233 active Covid-19 cases. Malaysia last Saturday logged a record high number of daily cases since the start of the pandemic, with 2,335 infections. Kuala Lumpur made up the largest share – 31.2 per cent – of the new infections, with 728 cases. This was followed by Selangor with 710 cases and Johor with 412 cases. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has doubled the number of beds at a government quarantine and treatment centre in Serdang in Selangor - located at the edge of Kuala Lumpur - to more than 6,000 due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases. The centre is at the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang or MAEPS. "The capacity of beds at MAEPS 2.0 has been increased by 3,032 to a total of 6,132," the ministry tweeted on Monday. It said the capacity of beds at the centre could be further raised to 10,000 beds, if required. "Deputy health director-general Datuk Dr Rohaizat Yon (medical) said the opening of a new hall in MAEPS follows the increase in Covid-19 cases," the ministry said. The MAEPS quarantine centre was activated from April 16 to July 15 and had cared for 1,362 patients, the majority of whom were non-Malaysians. On Dec 9, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said that the centre would be re-activated following an increase in Covid-19 cases among foreign workers.
COVID-19 patients showing no symptoms to stay home while hospitals deal with bed, ambulance shortage | Malaysia Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah has advised patients with COVID-19 who are not displaying symptoms of the disease to isolate at homes instead of hospitals while the country grapples with healthcare logistics. Hospitals have been struggling with the shortage of ambulances and beds as cases continue to rise in the country, the health chief told reporters today. The country had been sending asymptomatic coronavirus patients for two-week quarantine at its 27 hospitals, including the Kuala Lumpur Hospital and the Sungai Buloh. To date, there are 200,00 active cases. “The Ministry of Health is currently dealing with a very high number of cases and logistics issues when it comes to ferrying patients to hospitals,” Noor Hisham, 57, said. “We are talking about more than 1,000 cases a day.” “Foreign workers have no place to be isolated,” he added. Malaysia recorded 1,196 new infections yesterday. The total number of infections since the outbreak in February have reached 105,096. The death toll stands at 451. The Health Ministry today added more than 3,000 beds to the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang COVID-19 crisis center in Selangor, where infected foreign workers were being quarantined. People in the queue for hospitals due to COVID-19 were also advised to contact health officers of their respective districts on the status of hospital beds and ambulances.
China jails ex-lawyer for four years over Covid-19 reports in Wuhan | BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China has sentenced a former lawyer to four years in prison over her posts about the coronavirus response in Wuhan, a media report said, the first known conviction of someone who chronicled authorities' early struggle to manage the outbreak. Zhang Zhan, 37, was convicted on Monday (Dec 28), according to a tweet from the Hong Kong Free Press, which cited a lawyer. It did not give further details. The crime carries a maximum sentence of five years. The verdict represents China's latest effort to punish those who exposed shortcomings in the country's initial response to the virus, which was first discovered a year ago in the central city of Wuhan before spreading around the globe. After being accused of covering up the severity of the virus, President Xi Jinping's government has sought to recast its response as competent and compassionate. Zhang was among several people - professional journalists and amateurs alike - who rushed to cover the outbreak in Wuhan and its aftermath. Her posts included a video of hospital hallways lined with patients on oxygen and another suggesting that people had been charged for virus tests they expected to be free. The Covid-19 death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang - who was admonished by the local government for warning about the virus - sparked a rare public outcry demanding freedom of speech and questioning of the country's system of governance. While the government embraced Dr Li's story, framing him as a martyr rather than a silenced whistle-blower, authorities also launched investigations into other critics of Beijing's response. Such incidents undercut the official narrative and fanned speculation that the outbreak could feed discontent with the ruling party. The revelations have also helped fuelled criticism from US President Donald Trump and others that China played down the outbreak and contributed to its spread around the world. Zhang stopped posting in May and authorities later revealed that she had been detained on allegations of spreading lies. Her lawyer told CBS News earlier this month that she had been force-fed after starting a hunger strike in detention and that her health had deteriorated. Several other citizen journalists have disappeared from Wuhan, part of what Human Rights Watch said on Saturday was a surge in such detentions. The New York-based group called for China to drop all charges and release journalists being held.
