E.U. Starts Effort to Vaccinate 450 Million | BERLIN — From nursing homes in France to hospitals in Poland, older Europeans and the workers who care for them rolled up their sleeves on Sunday to receive coronavirus vaccine shots in a campaign to inoculate more than 450 million people across the European Union. The inoculations offered a rare respite as the continent struggles with one of its most precarious moments since the pandemic began. Despite national lockdowns, restrictions on movement, shuttering of restaurants and cancellations of Christmas gatherings, the virus has stalked Europe into the dark winter months. The spread of a more contagious variant of the virus in Britain has raised such alarm that much of continental Europe rushed to close its borders to travelers coming from the country, effectively plunging the nation as a whole into quarantine. “Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year,” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president wrote on Twitter. “The #COVID19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries.” For Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, the vaccine’s arrival could not come soon enough. Italy’s suffering at the outset of the pandemic served as a warning for the world, and the current death toll is again among the worst in Europe. “Today Italy reawakens. It’s #VaccineDay,” he wrote on Twitter after a 29-year-old nurse at Rome’s Spallanzani hospital was the first person to be inoculated. “This date will remain with us forever.” The nurse, Claudia Alivernini, said she hoped the vaccination campaign would signal “the beginning of the end” of the pandemic. In Spain, a 96-year-old great-grandmother, Araceli Rosario Hidalgo, was the first to receive the vaccine. The Los Olmos nursing home, where she lives, is in Guadalajara, a city that has a special storage facility where the first doses of the vaccine were delivered on Saturday, transported from Belgium. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wrote on Twitter that the vaccinations marked “a hopeful new chapter.” Similar scenes played out across the continent, although not every member of the bloc followed the rollout plans. In Germany, a nursing home in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt jumped the gun, inoculating dozens of residents and staff members on Saturday, hours after the doses arrived. Officials in the Netherlands said they planned to begin vaccinations on Jan. 8. But all E.U. member nations now have a supply of vaccine on hand to distribute. Early Sunday, dozens of minivans carrying coolers filled with dry ice to keep the doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from rising above minus 70 degrees Celsius fanned out to nursing homes across the German capital. The rollout comes as Europe’s largest nation is confronting its deadliest period since the start of the pandemic. With nearly 1,000 deaths recorded in Germany each day in the week before Christmas, a crematory in the eastern state of Saxony operated around the clock, straight through the holiday, to keep up. “I’ve never had to see it this bad before,” said Eveline Müller, the director of the facility, in the town of Görlitz. More than 350,000 people in the 27 nations that make up the European Union have died from Covid-19 since the bloc’s first fatality was recorded in France on Feb. 15. And for many countries, the worst days have come in recent weeks. In Poland, November was the deadliest month since the end of World War II. The European Union’s member states made a show of solidarity by waiting for the bloc’s regulatory board to approve the vaccine before beginning coordinated national campaigns. But how those will play out in individual countries is likely to be disparate. All of the member states have national health care systems, so people will be vaccinated free of charge. But just as hospitals in poorer member states like Bulgaria and Romania were overwhelmed in the latest wave of the virus, the networks in those countries will face challenges in distributing vaccines. While each nation is determining how to carry out its campaign, in general the first phase will focus on people most at risk of exposure and those most likely to have serious health conditions — health care workers and the oldest citizens. Most member states have said they expect the vaccine to reach the general public by spring. As Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece got his shot on Sunday, he encouraged citizens to get one, too. “It’s the only way to take back control of our lives, to hug the people that we love,” he said.
2020 Take: Covid-19 Unravelled Gujarat's Industries, Migrants' March Induced Tears; Lions Roared Loud | Disruption of industrial activities due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, protests by jobless migrants eager to return home and hospital fires - all these and more kept Gujarat in the news during the year. Near-deserted roads, closed factories, business establishments and educational institutions defined life in the early months of the lockdown in the state. Public mask mandate, social distancing, hand hygiene, work from home and online education became buzzwords as people digested the magnitude of the global health crisis. The lockdown turned into a human tragedy in Gujarat as migrant labourers, rendered jobless and left with very little resources to fall back on, decided to leave for their native places. The restless migrant workers hit the streets to demand transport arrangements to travel back to their hometowns during the lockdown. These protests took violent turn in some cities. There were painful scenes of migrant workers returning to their home states by whatever means of transport they got. While some just walked towards their native places, others used cycles or any other vehicle available to make the return journey. The government later started special trains to ferry migrant workers to their respective states. Some patients were burnt alive in fire incidents while being treated at Gujarat's COVID-19 designated hospitals. For coronavirus patients in the ICU of Ahmedabad's Shrey Hospital, the intervening night of August 5 and 6 proved devastating. Eight patients perished in the massive fire at the hospital. On November 26 and 27 night, five COVID-19 patients died in a blaze in the ICU of a private hospital in Rajkot. A fire broke out at SSG Hospitals ICU in Vadodara but patients were saved as they were evacuated in time.

On November 26 and 27 night, five COVID-19 patients died in a blaze in the ICU of a private hospital in Rajkot. A fire broke out at SSG Hospitals ICU in Vadodara but patients were saved as they were evacuated in time. State authorities moved to ramp up testing labs, earmarked beds in hospitals for COVID-19 patients and set up quarantine facilities to deal with the rising cases. As the march of the coronavirus slowed down life, gritty tales of health professionals and frontline workers helping the fight against the infection came to light. The pandemic took a toll on the economy of Gujarat, one of the most industrialised states, social life and even affected the mental health of some people. The first case of coronavirus was reported in Gujarat on March 19 and the maiden death registered on March 22. Since then the health authorities have been dealing with increasing caseloads and deaths from across the state. Life started coming back on track after the unlocking process began and economic activities resumed. However, a second wave of COVID-19, which started after the festive season ended in mid-November, prompted the state government to introduce a night curfew in four major cities - Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat, died on November 25 due to complications related to COVID-19. Newly-elected BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat Abhay Bharadwaj died on December 2 due while undergoing treatment for COVID-19 complications. Former Gujarat chief minister Keshubhai Patel died on October 29 due to post-COVID-19 health-related issues, while Gujarati film actor Naresh Kanodia died while undergoing treatment for the viral infection. Former Union minister Bharatsinh Solanki survived the coronavirus after a struggle of 102 days in a hospital, while a 59-year-old man from Dholka town in Ahmedabad district defeated the virus after spending 113 days in a hospital. During his visits to his home state over the last two months, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched many projects including a sea-plane service, ro-pax ferry service and a ropeway in Gujarat. He also laid foundation stones for a mega hybrid energy park in Kutch district and desalination plants in the state. The BJP won all the eight Assembly seats where bypolls were held in November, boosting the stature of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. These seats fell vacant after sitting Congress MLAs resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls in June, paving the way for the BJP's victory on three of the four RS seats. The BJP's clean sweep in the Assembly bypolls raised question marks over the organisational strength of the state Congress, out of power in Gujarat for over two decades now. In news that brought cheers to wildlife lovers, the Gujarat forest department, after an estimation exercise in June, said the number of lions in Gir forests has increased from 523 in 2015 to 674 in 2020. The department did not carry out a full census this time due to the coronavirus pandemic. Decommissioned aircraft carrier INS Viraat is awaiting dismantling at the Alang ship breaking yard in Gujarat after hopes of converting the iconic ship into a museum faded. During the year, Gujarat saw two major industrial accidents in which 20 people died. In January, eight people were killed in a blast at an industrial and medical gas manufacturing company in Vadodara district, while on November 4, a powerful blast rocked a chemical storage unit in Ahmedabad, killing 12 people. Five Pakistanis allegedly trying to smuggle in drugs worth Rs 175 crore were apprehended on a fishing boat off the Gujarat coast in January by the Coast Guard.
India's Covid-19 tally climbs to 1.02 cr with 20,021 new cases; active cases drop to 2.77 lakh | India's daily number of coronavirus cases on Monday stood at 20,021. Up to 279 fresh fatalities were recorded in a span of 24 hours, pushing the overall death toll since the outbreak in January to 1,47,901. The country's overall positive Covid-19 cases stood at 1,02,07,871, with 2,77,301 active cases. The national capital recorded just 757 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, bringing much-needed relief to the Delhiites who have seen a sharp spike in cases in November. The total recovered coronavirus cases in the country stood at 97,82,669 with 21,131 new discharges in the last 24 hours. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday said 7,15,397 samples have been tested for coronavirus yesterday. The total number of samples tested so far in India are 16,88,18,054, the top medical body stated. India on Sunday recorded 18,732 fresh infections, the lowest since 1 July, when 18,653 cases were recorded. Meanwhile, the coronavirus caseload in the United States has surpassed 19 million, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University. As of 01:23 IST on Monday, Johns Hopkins University had registered 19,069,926 positive tests for the coronavirus infection in America. India's national coronavirus task force met recently amid the new mutant strain scare that has been traced in the United Kingdom and discussed surveillance strategies. More than 50 samples of people who have returned to India from the UK are currently being sequenced at six labs across the country to find out if they have the mutant strain. District surveillance officers are identifying passengers who have arrived from the UK in the past one month, as per reports. As the Covid-19 pandemic has paralysed economies, devastated communities and confined almost four billion people to their homes, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that the coronavirus crisis will not be the last pandemic, and attempts to improve human health are "doomed" without tackling climate change and animal welfare. In a video message marking Sunday's first International Day of Epidemic Preparedness, the WHO chief condemned the "dangerously short-sighted" cycle of throwing cash at outbreaks but doing nothing to prepare for the next one.
Thailand tracks 127 contacts of new Covid-19 case | BANGKOK (THE NATION/ASIA NEWS NETWORK, XINHUA) - Thailand has found a new case of Covid-19 since mass infections were reported in Samut Sakhon province earlier this month and in Rayong province a few days ago. The patient is a 46-year-old woman, a resident of Rayong's Muang district - south of Bangkok - who had arrived in the northern city of Chiang Mai on Dec 26. "She showed symptoms, such as dryness in the throat and 37.4 degrees (Celsius) temperature and received testing on December 27. She was found positive," said Dr Kittiphan Chalom, Chiang Mai's public health deputy chief, during an emergency meeting on Sunday (Dec 28). Dr Kittiphan added that the woman is now being treated in a negative pressure room at Nakornping Hospital in Mae Rim district in Chiang Mai. "This is considered an imported case from another province. There is still no local outbreak within Chiang Mai at the moment," he said. According to Dr Kittiphan, preliminary tracing of the patient's travel history revealed that she had visited a fitness centre in Rayong province on Dec 24 and had close contact with a trainer who was later confirmed as infected. On Dec 26, she travelled from U-Tapao Airport to Chiang Mai International Airport on Thai AirAsia flight FD101, seat 22C, with her husband, her two children and a babysitter. "In total, 127 persons have been found to have had contact with her and carry a risk of infection, 30 of whom carry high risk that health officials had already contacted them to collect samples for testing," said Dr Kittiphan. "The rest 97 persons were told to stay in self-quarantine to monitor their symptoms for 14 days." Thailand on Sunday recorded 121 new cases of Covid-19 infections. The new cases included 94 local infections, 18 Myanmar migrant workers in Samut Sakhon, a province near Bangkok where a cluster was discovered last week, and nine imported cases. Rayong province has also been officially declared a zone under maximum control, following the reported infections of 36 people, 29 of whom were allegedly involved in illegal gambling activity in the downtown area. The provincial governor of Rayong will soon decide whether lockdown measures will be enforced in all or in part of the eastern province, he said. Thailand has confirmed 6,141 Covid-19 cases so far. A total of 4,161 have fully recovered and been discharged from hospitals while 1,920 others are currently being hospitalised. The country has reported 60 fatalities from the coronavirus.
Highlights of COVID-19, government funding law taking effect | An employee of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, receives one of the first COVID-19 vaccines at the medical center, Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020. Wake Forest Baptist received its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Monday morning. Ten employees received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine Tuesday. Additional employees will be given the vaccine in the coming days. (Walt Unks/The Winston-Salem Journal via AP)(Walt Unks/The Winston-Salem Journal via AP) (AP) - The massive, year-end catchall bill that President Donald Trump signed into law combines $900 billion in COVID-19 aid with a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill and reams of other unfinished legislation on taxes, energy, education and health care. Highlights of the measure with overall funding amounts and specific amounts for some but not necessarily all initiatives. Unemployment insurance ($120 billion). Revives supplemental federal pandemic unemployment benefits but at $300 per week — through March 14 — instead of the $600 per week benefit that expired in July. Extends special pandemic benefits for “gig” workers and extends the maximum period for state-paid jobless benefits to 50 weeks. Direct payments ($166 billion). Provides $600 direct payments to individuals making up to $75,000 per year and couples making up to $150,000 per year — with payments phased out for higher incomes —- with $600 additional payments per dependent child. Paycheck Protection Program ($284 billion). Revives the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to qualified businesses. Especially hard-hit businesses that received PPP grants would be eligible for a second round. Ensures that PPP subsidies are not taxed. Vaccines, testing, health providers ($69 billion). Delivers more than $30 billion for procurement of vaccines and treatments, distribution funds for states, and a strategic stockpile. Adds $22 billion for testing, tracing and mitigation, $9 billion for health care providers, and $4.5 billion for mental health. Schools and universities ($82 billion). Delivers $54 billion to public K-12 schools affected by the pandemic and $23 billion for colleges and universities; $4 billion would be awarded to a Governors Emergency Education Relief Fund; nearly $1 billion for Native American schools. Rental assistance ($25 billion). Provides money for a first-ever federal rental assistance program; funds to be distributed by state and local governments to help people who have fallen behind on their rent and may be facing eviction. Food/farm aid ($26 billion). Increases stamp benefits by 15% for six months and provides funding to food banks, Meals on Wheels and other food aid. Provides an equal amount ($13 billion) to farmers and ranchers. Child Care ($10 billion). Provides $10 billion to the Child Care Development Block Grant to help families with child care costs and help providers cover increased operating costs. Postal Service ($10 billion). Forgives a $10 billion loan to the Postal Service provided in earlier relief legislation. The omnibus measure wraps 12 spending bills into one and funds agency operating budgets through Sept. 30 of next year. It combines Democratic priorities such as a $12.5 billion increase over existing budget limits for domestic programs while cutting Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention and removal costs by $431 million. COVID-19 has contributed to sharply lower costs. Republicans supported sustained defense spending, energy provisions and longstanding bans on federal funding of abortion. The measure also provides President Donald Trump with a last, $1.4 billion installment for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The measure also contains more than 3,000 pages of miscellaneous legislation, such as: Surprise medical billing. Includes bipartisan legislation to protect consumers from huge surprise medical bills after receiving treatment from out-of-network providers. Community health centers. Reauthorizes, for three years, funding for community health centers and extends a variety of expiring health care policies, including reimbursement rates for various health care providers and procedures under Medicare and Medicaid Tax extenders. Extends a variety of expiring tax breaks, including lower excise taxes on craft brewers and distillers. Renewable energy sources would see tax breaks extended, as would motorsport facilities, and people making charitable contributions. Business meals would be 100% deductible through 2022 and out-of-pocket health care costs would be deductible after they reach 7.5% of income. It would also extend favorable tax treatment for “look through” entities of offshore subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Water projects. Includes an almost 400-page water resources bill that targets $10 billion for 46 Army Corps of Engineers flood control, environmental and coastal protection projects. Clean energy. Boosts “clean energy” programs like research and development, efficiency incentives and tax credits. Phases out “superpollutant” hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Education. Includes a bipartisan agreement to forgive about $1.3 billion in federal loans to historically Black colleges and universities and simplify college financial aid forms. Boosts the maximum Pell Grant for low-income college students by $150 to $6,495. Offers “second chance” Pell Grants to incarcerated prisoners. Horse racing “doping.” Adds bipartisan legislation by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to create national medication and safety standards for the horse racing industry as lawmakers move to clamp down on the use of performance-enhancing drugs that can lead to horse injuries and deaths. New Smithsonian museums. Establishes the Women’s History Museum and the National Museum of the American Latino as new Smithsonian museums located near the National Mall. Pipeline safety. Folds in pipeline safety legislation reauthorizing operating grants and safety standards for oil and gas pipelines. Aircraft safety. Adds, after the scandal involving Boeing 737 MAX crashes, legislation to beef up the Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft certification process. Addresses human factors, automation in the cockpit, and international pilot training while authorizing nearly $275 million over the next five years to carry out the legislation.
Lee County COVID-19 vaccinations begin Monday for people 65 and older | Starting Monday, the Florida Department of Health in Lee County will begin COVID-19 vaccinations for high-risk frontline health care workers and those 65 and older. DOH-Lee staff will have 300 doses of vaccine available at each site, supported by Lee County Public Safety. The first of seven testing sites will be at Estero Park and Recreation Center. Those who stopped by the Etero site say this could be the first step to getting back to pre-pandemic normalcy. Monday’s vaccination opportunity represents hope for Deane and Dick Hall of Bonita Springs. “We’re excited to get the vaccination and we can’t wait to get it,” Deane said. After months of not being able to hug their grandkids, there’s finally a light at the end of the tunnel. “I’d like to put COVID 2020 to bed and go on with a better year,” Dick said. That ray of light comes in the form of the Estero Parks and Rec Center where high-risk frontline health care workers and those 65 and older can get the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Karlene Reilly is from Estero and sees this opportunity for a vaccine as thrilling. “Absolutely thrilled that there is a possibility. It’s really an answer to a prayer. and I hope that I am able to get it,” Reilly said. She came to the center to see if she could find out more information about what to do prior to getting in line. There, she learned that there is a release form to fill out. “I’ve been trying to be as careful as I can be but I think I would feel better if I had the vaccine in my system,” said Reilly. 2020 has been challenging and worrisome for many but they think the vaccine is a good way to ring in a new year. “It’s the beginning of the new year,” said Dick. “Let’s hope we can all get it very quickly,” Reilly said. The Moderna vaccine does require two doses which are meant to be given 28 days apart. WINK News reached out to the Department of Health about getting the second dose if you happen to get the first one but they have not yet responded.
Donald Trump signs Covid-19 relief and spending bill | Donald Trump has signed the Covid-19 relief and spending bill after days of delays, preventing a mid-pandemic government shutdown. The announcement on Sunday night after Republicans urged him to act following his refusal to sign the bill, a decision that meant millions of Americans lost unemployment aid. Trump blindsided members of both parties and upended months of negotiations when he demanded last week that the package – already passed by the House and Senate by large margins and believed to have Trump’s support – be revised to include larger relief checks and scaled-back spending. But on Sunday night Trump released a statement that he had signed the bill, saying it was his “responsibility to protect the people of our country from the economic devastation and hardship” caused by coronavirus. “As president, I have told Congress that I want far less wasteful spending and more money going to the American people in the form of $2,000 checks per adult and $600 per child. “I am signing this bill to restore unemployment benefits, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, add money for PPP, return our airline workers back to work, add substantially more money for vaccine distribution, and much more.” He ended the statement by saying “Much more money is coming,” although he provided nothing to back this promise. Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, welcomed the move. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed Trump’s signing as a “down payment on what is needed” saying: “Now, the president must immediately call on congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000.” Shares in Asia ticked upwards on news that Trump had signed the bill, and US stock futures rose 0.4%. In the face of growing economic hardship and spreading disease, lawmakers had urged Trump on Sunday to sign the legislation immediately, then have Congress follow up with additional aid. Aside from unemployment benefits and relief payments to families, money for vaccine distribution, businesses, and cash-starved public transit systems is on the line. Protections against evictions also hang in the balance. It was not immediately clear why Trump changed his mind as his resistance to the massive legislative package promised a chaotic final stretch of his presidency. White House officials have been tight-lipped about Trump’s thinking but a source familiar with the situation cited by Reuters said that some advisers had urged him to relent because they did not see the point of refusing. Republican officials were relieved that Trump had backed away from his veiled veto threat, saying it should help Republican Senate candidates David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in the Georgia runoff elections on 5 January that will determine control of the Senate. Earlier on Sunday, Republican senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said he understood that Trump “wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire”. Toomey added: “So I think the best thing to do, as I said, sign this and then make the case for subsequent legislation.” The same point was echoed by Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has criticised Trump’s pandemic response and his efforts to undo the election results. “I just gave up guessing what he might do next,” he said. Republican representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said too much was at stake for Trump to “play this old switcheroo game”. “I don’t get the point,” he said. “I don’t understand what’s being done, why, unless it’s just to create chaos and show power and be upset because you lost the election.” Washington has been reeling since Trump turned on the deal, without warning, after it had won sweeping approval in both houses of Congress and after the White House had assured Republican leaders that Trump would support it. The bill had lain unsigned on his desk since Christmas Day as the president, who was mostly silent through weeks of intense negotiations, spent the weekend at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach. Instead, he assailed the bill’s plan to provide $600 Covid-19 relief checks to most Americans – insisting it should be $2,000 – and took issue with spending included in an attached $1.4 trillion government funding bill to keep the federal government operating through September. And already, his opposition has had consequences, as two federal programs providing unemployment aid expired on Saturday. Lauren Bauer of the Brookings Institution had calculated that at least 11 million people would lose aid immediately as a result of Trump’s failure to sign the legislation; millions more would exhaust other unemployment benefits within weeks. How and when people are affected by the lapse depends on the state they live in, the program they are relying on and when they applied for benefits. In some states, people on regular unemployment insurance will continue to receive payments under a program that extends benefits when the jobless rate surpassed a certain threshold, said Andrew Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert and senior fellow at the Century Foundation think tank. About 9.5 million people, however, had been relying on the pandemic unemployment assistance program that expired altogether Saturday. That program made unemployment insurance available to freelancers, gig workers and others normally not eligible. After receiving their last checks, those recipients will not be able to file for more aid, Stettner said. Joe Biden, who won November’s presidential election and who will be sworn in as Trump’s successor on 20 January, accused him of an “abdication of responsibility” in a statement on Saturday. The relief bill wrangles come as the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the US, with medical experts joining Biden in predicting that the darkest days lay ahead. “We very well might see a post-seasonal, in the sense of Christmas, New Year, surge,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the US head of infectious diseases, told CNN on Sunday.
US surpasses 19m Covid-19 cases: Johns Hopkins University | WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States surpassed 19 million coronavirus cases Sunday (Dec 27), figures from Johns Hopkins University showed, adding one million new cases in less than a week. The US recorded 165,151 new cases in 24 hours at 8:30 pm (0130 GMT Monday), the Baltimore-based institution said, bringing the overall total to 19,107,675 cases. The grim new milestone comes just six days after the US crossed the 18 million case threshold. The US also has a total of 333,069 virus-related deaths. Both the caseload and death toll are by far the highest in the world. Coronavirus cases have been surging at an alarming rate in the US in recent months. The world's largest economy has added at least one million new cases per week since early November, according to an AFP tally of Johns Hopkins data. And on Saturday, Johns Hopkins calculated that one in 1,000 Americans have died of Covid-19. More than a million Americans have received the first dose of their Covid-19 vaccines, a milestone in the biggest immunization drive in US history, but officials admitted the pace of rollout was slipping behind schedule. Additionally, the vaccines will not help the current surge in cases. Top US government scientist Anthony Fauci warned earlier Sunday that the worst of the pandemic may be yet to come, driving the country to a "critical point" as holiday travel spreads the coronavirus.
Trump signs COVID-19 pandemic aid and spending Bill, averting government shutdown | WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday (Dec 28) signed into law a US$2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package, restoring unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and averting a federal government shutdown in a crisis of his own making. Trump, who leaves office on Jan 20 after losing November's election, backed down from his threat to block the Bill, which was approved by Congress last week, after he came under intense pressure from lawmakers on both sides. The Republican president, who golfed on Sunday and remained out of public view even as the potential government shutdown loomed, had demanded that Congress change the Bill to increase the size of stimulus checks for struggling Americans to US$2,000 from US$600. It was not immediately clear why Trump changed his mind as his resistance to the massive legislative package promised a chaotic final stretch of his presidency. White House officials have been tight-lipped about Trump's thinking but a source familiar with the situation said some advisers had urged him to relent because they did not see the point of refusing. "Good news on Covid Relief Bill. Information to follow!" Trump said in a cryptic message on Twitter earlier on Sunday evening. But he offered no explanation. Democrats are on board with the US$2,000 payments but many Republicans have opposed it in the past. Many economists agree the financial aid in the Bill should be higher to get the economy moving again but say that immediate support for Americans hit by COVID-19 lockdowns is still urgently needed. Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million people through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but will be restarted now that Trump has signed the Bill. The package includes US$1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies. If Trump had not signed the legislation, then a partial government shutdown would have begun on Tuesday that would have put millions of government workers' incomes at risk. Global share prices ticked up in response to the news that Trump had passed the stimulus plan and backed away from a government spending crisis. US S&P futures and Japan's Nikkei index gained around 0.4 per cent, and spot gold prices rose nearly 1 per cent.  "It is positive for markets that we no longer have a chaos over stimulus, considering there was a chance of a partial government shutdown," said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief strategist at Sumimoto Mitsui DS Asset Management. Trump’s abrupt move to sign the Bill came after most Republican lawmakers refused to back his call for changes to legislation they had already voted on. Hours earlier, Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told Fox News Sunday Trump wants "to be remembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire". Republican officials were relieved that Trump had backed away from his veiled veto threat, saying it should help Republican Senate candidates David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in Jan 5 runoff elections that will determine control of the US Senate. Trump sought to put the best face on his climb-down, saying he was signing the Bill with "a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed". He noted that Democratic-controlled House of Representatives planned to vote on Monday to increase coronavirus relief checks to individuals from US$600 to US$2,000, and said the Senate "will start the process" to approve higher payments. US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Republican, said "I thank the President for signing this relief into law" but made no mention of any plans for a Senate vote. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed Trump's signing as a "down payment on what is needed", saying: "Now, the President must immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to US$2,000." After months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he later said he was unhappy with the massive Bill, which provides US$892 billion in COVID-19 financial relief. Trump spent the Christmas holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. On Sunday morning, he seemed in no rush to try to resolve the standoff with Congress as he played a round of golf at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. He had also complained that the Bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid. In his signing statement, Trump also sought to keep alive his campaign of baseless claims that the November election was rigged against him. He said the House and Senate "have agreed to focus strongly on the very substantial voter fraud" and that the Senate will launch an investigation. Neither McConnell nor Pelosi made mention of such an agreement. Democratic lawmakers have steadfastly rejected Trump's claims as have some Republicans. McConnell angered Trump by recognising Biden as president-elect. Americans are living through a bitter holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000 people, the highest since the pandemic began. The relief package also extends a moratorium on evictions that was due to expire on Dec 31, refreshes support for small business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution. 
Fu Yu Corp a ‘stable dividend dispenser’ despite Covid-19: RHB | Despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, RHB Securities has remained bullish on Fu Yu Corp as a “stable dividend dispenser”. The brokerage expects the precision plastic components manufacturer to make a 1.7 cents payout for FY20, which translates to an “attractive” yield of 6.3%. This comes as Fu Yu has a strong net cash position of $97.8 million and zero borrowings, it notes. “Despite a blip in FY20 caused by the Covid-19 situation, we believe Fu Yu – with a strong net cash balance sheet – will [be] able to weather the storm,” RHB head of research Jarick Seet writes in a noted dated Dec 28. “We also think that it can at the same time provide its investors with attractive dividends despite an estimated temporary drop in profits for FY20,” he adds.  RHB has maintained its “buy” rating for the stock with an unchanged target price of 30 cents. As at 10.42 am, Fu Yu was flat at 25.5 cents with 11,800 shares changed hands.
5 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, including 1 in community | SINGAPORE: Five new COVID-19 cases were reported in Singapore as of noon on Monday (Dec 28), said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its daily preliminary update. Of the new cases, one is in the community. It is the first community case in the country since Dec 21. Four of the new cases were imported. All four cases were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon their arrival in Singapore. Details of the new cases will be released on Monday night, said the health ministry. Singapore entered Phase 3 of its reopening on Monday. Social gatherings of up to eight people will be allowed in public, up from five currently. Similarly, households can receive up to eight visitors. Worship services are now allowed to have up to 250 people, and capacity limits in public places such as malls and attractions have been increased as well. The Government will begin vaccinating healthcare workers from Dec 30, beginning with those at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), said MOH on Sunday. Vaccinations will subsequently be rolled out to more healthcare institutions. This will be followed by vaccinations for the elderly, starting with those aged 70 years and above, from February.  "Thereafter we will vaccinate other Singaporeans and long-term residents who are medically eligible for vaccination. More details will be shared in due course," said MOH.  The vaccine will be free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents, including long-term work permit holders. As of Monday, Singapore has reported a total of 58,529 COVID-19 cases.
Singapore records 5 new cases of Covid-19, including 1 in the community | This takes the number of coronavirus cases here to 58,529. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said that in addition to the locally transmitted infection, there were four imported cases. These patients were placed on stay-home notices or isolated on arrival in Singapore.MOH is working through the details of the cases and will provide more information on Monday night. This report will be updated.
COVID-19: Hawker centre seat markings revised, restrictions at some markets to be removed in Phase 3 | SINGAPORE: Hawker centres and markets across Singapore will see safe management measures adjusted in Phase 3 of Singapore’s reopening. The National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Monday (Dec 28) that seat markings have been revised at the dining areas of hawker centres to accommodate the increase in group sizes of up to eight people. Additionally, more markets will see access control and interim fencing removed. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, NEA, NEA-appointed operators and town councils have marked out seats and tables at dining areas of hawker centres in accordance with safe distancing guidelines. With Phase 3, markings on seats and tables at the dining areas of hawker centres have been revised to accommodate the increase in dining group size from five to eight people. In general, tables with eight seats or fewer will no longer have any seat markings. Tables with more than eight seats will still have some seats marked out to ensure that dining groups remain limited to eight people and that there is a one-metre safe distance between groups. "In addition, where seats at adjacent tables (eg back-to-back) are less than 1m apart, some seats may also be marked out to maintain a safe distance between dining groups at different tables," said NEA. Safe distancing ambassadors will continue to be deployed at hawker centres to ensure compliance with safe management measures. "Besides keeping to safe management measures, patrons should also continue to bin their litter, such as used disposables, tissues and wet wipes, and return crockery and trays to designated collection points," said NEA. "This will help to keep the dining environment at our hawker centres clean, and reduce the risk of disease transmission to other patrons, cleaners and hawkers." Access control and interim fencing were implemented from April at 40 crowded markets to prevent patrons from entering once the number of patrons in each market reached the allowed capacity. Since then, NEA has progressively removed interim fencing at a total of 20 markets in two separate reviews in June and November. There are currently 81 markets managed by NEA and NEA-appointed operators.
Malaysia's asymptomatic Covid-19 patients to isolate at home first as worker cases surge | KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia is advising people who have tested positive for the coronavirus but have no Covid-19 symptoms to self-isolate at home first, as cases involving foreign workers are surging. These asymptomatic patients should keep in contact with their district health offices. The Health Ministry's director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said these patients may not be taken to hospitals immediately, as the healthcare system is overloaded, Malay Mail online news reported him as saying on Monday (Dec 28). Malaysia is grappling with logistical issues such as the ferrying of people to hospitals and a high number of foreign workers being tested and found to have Covid-19. "We are talking about more than 1,000 cases a day. This is because of increased testing among foreign workers, and as expected more cases being diagnosed," Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham said, as quoted by Malay Mail. "Foreign workers have no place to be isolated in... We have thousands here. We are increasing the number of (hospital) beds to 10,000." Malaysia has stepped up the testing of foreign workers for Covid-19. Enforcement on the mandatory Covid-19 screening for foreign workers will start from Jan 1 - only for the six high-risk states and federal territories, said Human Resources Minister M. Saravanan, The Star daily reported. These state comprise Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Penang and Sabah, along with the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Labuan, involving some 800,000 foreign workers. For other states, mass testing on foreign workers will start after February next year. Datuk Seri Saravanan said that as at Sunday, a total of 68,460 foreign workers had been screened, involving 2,385 employers, according to The Star. The authorities have been intensely checking on foreign-worker accommodation in the last few weeks and issuing fines on companies including glovemakers for housing the migrants in cramped and poor conditions, that have partly caused the spread of Covid-19. Malaysia recorded 1,196 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, according to Malay Mail. It currently has 20,233 active Covid-19 cases. Malaysia last Saturday logged a record high number of daily cases since the start of the pandemic, with 2,335 infections. Kuala Lumpur made up the largest share – 31.2 per cent – of the new infections, with 728 cases. This was followed by Selangor with 710 cases and Johor with 412 cases. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has doubled the number of beds at a government quarantine and treatment centre in Serdang in Selangor - located at the edge of Kuala Lumpur - to more than 6,000 due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases. The centre is at the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang or MAEPS. "The capacity of beds at MAEPS 2.0 has been increased by 3,032 to a total of 6,132," the ministry tweeted on Monday. It said the capacity of beds at the centre could be further raised to 10,000 beds, if required. "Deputy health director-general Datuk Dr Rohaizat Yon (medical) said the opening of a new hall in MAEPS follows the increase in Covid-19 cases," the ministry said. The MAEPS quarantine centre was activated from April 16 to July 15 and had cared for 1,362 patients, the majority of whom were non-Malaysians. On Dec 9, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said that the centre would be re-activated following an increase in Covid-19 cases among foreign workers.
COVID-19 patients showing no symptoms to stay home while hospitals deal with bed, ambulance shortage | Malaysia Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah has advised patients with COVID-19 who are not displaying symptoms of the disease to isolate at homes instead of hospitals while the country grapples with healthcare logistics. Hospitals have been struggling with the shortage of ambulances and beds as cases continue to rise in the country, the health chief told reporters today. The country had been sending asymptomatic coronavirus patients for two-week quarantine at its 27 hospitals, including the Kuala Lumpur Hospital and the Sungai Buloh. To date, there are 200,00 active cases. “The Ministry of Health is currently dealing with a very high number of cases and logistics issues when it comes to ferrying patients to hospitals,” Noor Hisham, 57, said. “We are talking about more than 1,000 cases a day.” “Foreign workers have no place to be isolated,” he added. Malaysia recorded 1,196 new infections yesterday. The total number of infections since the outbreak in February have reached 105,096. The death toll stands at 451. The Health Ministry today added more than 3,000 beds to the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang COVID-19 crisis center in Selangor, where infected foreign workers were being quarantined. People in the queue for hospitals due to COVID-19 were also advised to contact health officers of their respective districts on the status of hospital beds and ambulances.
China jails ex-lawyer for four years over Covid-19 reports in Wuhan | BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China has sentenced a former lawyer to four years in prison over her posts about the coronavirus response in Wuhan, a media report said, the first known conviction of someone who chronicled authorities' early struggle to manage the outbreak. Zhang Zhan, 37, was convicted on Monday (Dec 28), according to a tweet from the Hong Kong Free Press, which cited a lawyer. It did not give further details. The crime carries a maximum sentence of five years. The verdict represents China's latest effort to punish those who exposed shortcomings in the country's initial response to the virus, which was first discovered a year ago in the central city of Wuhan before spreading around the globe. After being accused of covering up the severity of the virus, President Xi Jinping's government has sought to recast its response as competent and compassionate. Zhang was among several people - professional journalists and amateurs alike - who rushed to cover the outbreak in Wuhan and its aftermath. Her posts included a video of hospital hallways lined with patients on oxygen and another suggesting that people had been charged for virus tests they expected to be free. The Covid-19 death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang - who was admonished by the local government for warning about the virus - sparked a rare public outcry demanding freedom of speech and questioning of the country's system of governance. While the government embraced Dr Li's story, framing him as a martyr rather than a silenced whistle-blower, authorities also launched investigations into other critics of Beijing's response. Such incidents undercut the official narrative and fanned speculation that the outbreak could feed discontent with the ruling party. The revelations have also helped fuelled criticism from US President Donald Trump and others that China played down the outbreak and contributed to its spread around the world. Zhang stopped posting in May and authorities later revealed that she had been detained on allegations of spreading lies. Her lawyer told CBS News earlier this month that she had been force-fed after starting a hunger strike in detention and that her health had deteriorated. Several other citizen journalists have disappeared from Wuhan, part of what Human Rights Watch said on Saturday was a surge in such detentions. The New York-based group called for China to drop all charges and release journalists being held.
Five new Covid-19 cases in Singapore, four imported and one in the community | [SINGAPORE] There were five new coronavirus cases confirmed as at Monday noon (Dec 28), taking Singapore's total to 58,529. There were four imported cases who were placed on stay-home notices or isolated on arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).
5 new Covid-19 cases in Singapore, with 4 imported and 1 in community | SINGAPORE - There were five new coronavirus cases confirmed as at Monday noon (Dec 28), taking Singapore's total to 58,529. There were four imported cases who were placed on stay-home notice or isolated on arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). There was one new community case and none from worker dormitories. On Sunday, five new coronavirus cases were reported. All of them were imported. Among the five, a 23-year-old female work permit holder had served a stay-home notice at Mandarin Orchard Singapore before she was transferred to another dedicated facility on Dec 20. On that day, MOH commenced investigations into 13 previously reported cases who had served stay-home notices at the hotel between Oct 22 and Nov 11. The 13 cases, which came from 10 different countries, were infected by coronavirus strains with "high genetic similarity", which implied that the infections might have come from one source and could have happened in the hotel. The Malaysian, identified on Sunday night as Case 58,762, was swabbed on Dec 19 and Dec 21 and her test results were negative for Covid-19 infection. Her swab last Thursday at the end of her stay-home notice came back positive, and she was taken to the hospital the next day. A confirmatory test by the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) was also positive. However, a second sample taken by NPHL last Saturday returned negative, and her serological test result has also come back negative, said MOH. The latter test determines if the infection was an old one. Investigations are being done to determine if she could be linked to the 13 cases being investigated by MOH. She was the third Covid-19 patient who tested positive for the virus after serving part of a stay-home notice at Mandarin Orchard Singapore. The two other cases were announced last Friday and Saturday. Among the four other imported cases on Sunday, one is a permanent resident. The 33-year-old man returned from Ukraine. The remaining three are foreign domestic workers holding work permits. They included two Indonesians aged 37 and 38, and a 48-year-old Filipino woman. All five patients had all already been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving their notices. Singapore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 complications, while 15 who tested positive have died of other causes. Globally, the virus outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected more than 80.7 million people. More than 1.76 million people have died.
Julie Tan, Jeremy Chan, Dawn Yeoh apologise for Covid-19 breach at party with Terence Cao, Jeffrey Xu, Shane Pow | Not long after the big hoo-ha last week over four Mediacorp artistes — Terence Cao, Jeffrey Xu, Shane Pow, and Sonia Chew — flouting Covid-19 rules at a birthday celebration in October, three more celebrities have publicly apologised for participating in the very same party. Actress Julie Tan, who is currently managed by veteran actor Li Nanxing's agency LNX Global, recently took to Instagram to reflect on her actions. "I have made a mistake. I recognised the selfishness of my actions," she wrote. Noting that she has failed to be a good role model, she said she accepts full responsibility for the incident. "I ask for your forgiveness and the opportunity to be judged on my response to failure," the 28-year-old pleaded. Jeremy Chan, who is married to actress Jesseca Liu, also wrote in his Instagram post: "First of all, I would like to say sorry to all Singaporeans. I have made my family, friends and those who support me worry, I am sincerely sorry. It is everyone's responsibility to maintain social distancing and observe safety measures." The 39-year-old went on to apologise for breaking the rules and acknowledged that he was wrong. While she was not pictured in the group photo of the birthday celebration, local actress Dawn Yeoh admitted to attending the party in October. "I am sorry I made a mistake. I had shown indiscretion and lapsed in social responsibility in the recent reported photo of the mass gathering. I have come forward to the authorities and shall take full responsibility for my actions," the 34-year-old wrote. In addition to the apology statement released by Mediacorp on behalf of all the celebrities, the people involved have also individually posted on their social media accounts. Terence apologised for making a mistake in "a severe lapse of judgement" and said: "I accept full responsibility for my mistake and I sincerely apologise for my actions. I am truly sorry." Jeffrey shared: "I feel regretful and guilty for my wrongdoings. I am sorry to have let the friends and family who love me suffer all this and make them worry." Shane was regretful of his actions and for risking the health of the people around him by disregarding safety measures. "I will do better, I will be better, and I will set myself to a better standard than I was. I'm sorry," he added. Sonia, who was recently dropped by Mediacorp as the host in their countdown show, posted a long message on her Instagram account. "Firstly, I want to sincerely apologise for my actions. Upon seeing that there were more than five people present, I should have removed myself from that situation, and I didn't. I'm fully responsible for that. This is by no means a way to make excuses for what happened." She explained that she thought she was invited to have drinks with a small group of people and not a birthday celebration. "It's been a really tough time for my family to witness how distraught I was the last few days. I feel terrible for putting them through this. I want to thank my friends and loved ones who have been nothing but loving and supportive, and I sincerely apologise to each and everyone of you in this space," she wrote.
COVID-19: Most diners sticking to smaller groups on first day of Phase 3 | SINGAPORE: Singapore entered Phase 3 of its reopening on Monday (Dec 28), just three days before the end of 2020. This comes after one of the requirements for moving to Phase 3 - having more than 70 per cent of Singapore residents on the TraceTogether programme - was met on Dec 23. Social gatherings of up to eight people are now allowed in public, up from five. Similarly, households can receive up to eight visitors at any one time. At malls and large standalone stores, capacity limits for venues have been eased, from 10 sq m per person to 8 sq m per person. When CNA visited Junction 8 in Bishan in the late morning, restaurants were filling up, but there were only a handful of groups with six or more people - mostly students and the elderly. For student David Lim, who had gathered with a group of friends to play volleyball and have lunch, the changes were much welcomed. “It’s pretty epic because now we can play volleyball in groups of eight. Before, we could only play in groups of five - which was three versus two. That wasn’t very fun,” said the student from Nanyang Junior College. Phase 3 has also come at an opportune time, according to 14-year-old Rachel Yeo, who was with five other friends from her gymnastics team. The last time the group of six met was at the start of 2019. “We haven’t seen each other in such a long time and it’s good because it’s just in time before the school holidays end,” the student told CNA. At the food court, a group of seven people in their 60s and 70s sipped tea amid animated conversations. “We are enjoying this because previously, only a few people could meet, but we have so many friends. How to manage?” joked 72-year-old Diane Goh. In line with the start of Phase 3, the National Environment Agency (NEA), NEA-appointed operators, and town councils have revised markings on seats and tables at the dining areas of hawker centres to accommodate group sizes of up to eight people, said the agency in a press release on Monday. Access control and interim fencing at more markets will also be removed in Phase 3. In general, tables with eight seats or fewer will no longer have any seat markings, but tables with more than eight seats will still have some seats marked out. This is to ensure that dining groups do not exceed eight people and there is 1m of safe distancing between groups, said NEA in the press release. At Tiong Bahru Market, which had its access control and interim fencing removed in November, most diners kept to smaller groups even though the markings on seats and tables were removed. Mr Josh Tan, 29, and his five colleagues were having breakfast at the market on Monday morning after going for a walk at the nearby Henderson Waves. They had originally planned the outing before the Phase 3 announcement and intended to go ahead with just five of them, he told CNA. “Just nice the news came, then we thought we could invite more people,” said Mr Tan. “It’s good that more people are able to go out together. Especially with Chinese New Year coming, it’s a great thing.” Mdm Lau, 72, who declined to give her full name, was having her weekly Monday morning gathering with her neighbours at the market. Before COVID-19, the group used to gather at different markets across Singapore every Monday in groups of eight to 10 or more, she told CNA. “I’m happy. No need to go and choose and invite friends, and can sit (at) the same table,” said Mdm Lau, on the new regulations. While they have been meeting as a group of five for the past few months, the group decided to bring another friend along this Monday, with the new Phase 3 restrictions allowing six of them to dine together, she added. “It would be the best if we could meet in a group of 10 people,” her friend Mdm Lim, 68, added in Mandarin. “It’s been a while since we have been to this market together.” At Ngee Ann City along Orchard Road, capacity limits have been eased from 8,000 to 10,000 people. Diners in the malls along the shopping belt mostly stuck to groups of fewer than five - in part because seating to accommodate more than that had not been set up yet. However, other restaurants that CNA spoke to said they were prepared to seat and take reservations from bigger groups.Chairman of The Prive Group Mr Yuan Oeij said their outlets have made changes to the restaurants’ layouts. After it was announced on Dec 14 that Singapore would enter Phase 3, there was “a flood” of reservations and bookings, he added. “In terms of preparation, it’s just the routine tweaking of our layout and seating, to ensure we continue to adhere to the usual rules of safe distancing,” Mr Oeij told CNA. “Also given the festive season, there will be even more pressure from a minority of customers who do not understand safe distancing sufficiently and want operators to break the rules, and we want to ensure we are ever vigilant against such pressure.” Mr Oeij also attributed the uptick in reservations to the end-of-year festive season. Empress, a Chinese restaurant under the group, has also seen an increase in bookings for large tables in anticipation of Chinese New Year. At restaurants that have already optimised their seating layouts, operations will not look too different. “To respect the rule of having groups one metre apart, not much is (changing) in terms of capacity … It’s just about accepting bigger groups,” said Mohammed Sufi Hassan Jubri, chief operating officer of The Black Hole Group, which runs restaurants such as Tipo Pasta Bar in Kampong Glam. “It's more about handling customer expectations because with bigger groups there might be longer service times and waiting times,” he added. To deal with a potential surge in numbers, the group has also implemented digital queue management systems to avoid lines at its doors. Aside from shopping and dining, Singaporeans have more to look forward to in Phase 3. Attractions may seek approval to raise their operating capacities from 50 per cent to up to 65 per cent, with measures in place to prevent crowding in popular areas. More than 10 attractions have expressed interest or submitted their applications to do so, according to Ms Jean Ng, executive director for Attractions, Entertainment and Tourism Concept Development at the Singapore Tourism Board. As of Dec 22, four attractions have received approvals for the increase in capacity, namely: Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari. The capacity of Wildlife Reserves Singapore’s (WRS) four parks will increase with Singapore’s move to Phase 3, said its spokesperson. “We are planning for the revised capacity and to cater for the enhanced numbers, while keeping to the safe management measures to ensure a conducive environment for everyone to enjoy our wildlife parks,” said the spokesperson. Additional measures at Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari and Singapore Zoo will include an increased deployment of safe distancing ambassadors, especially during peak days, the spokesperson added. “We have always enjoyed steady support by the local community, the majority of whom experience our parks in a safe and socially responsible manner. “We would like to urge visitors to continue to adhere to the safe management measures in place, including safe distancing and wearing of face masks, as we enter the next phase of recovery.” For congregational and other worship services, capacities will be increased to up to 250 people, MOH announced on Dec 14.  Live performance elements will also be allowed at such services, along with religious rites or prayers conducted at places of worship, with the necessary safe management measures in place. The Singapore Sinhalese Buddhist Association (SSBA) told CNA it currently has approval to accommodate up to 150 devotees, but it is working towards getting the green light for 250. That would bode well for the mass gatherings it has in the pipeline. SSBA’s President U. W. (Siri) Amarasuriya said it is holding some events this week that will likely attract more than 100 devotees, but another gathering on New Year’s Day could attract “possibly at least 150 devotees”. More attendees will also be allowed for marriage solemnisations at home, with the hosting household now able to invite up to eight visitors in Phase 3, excluding members of the hosting household, the solemniser and vendors. Previously, a total of 10 people, including members of the household but excluding the solemniser and vendors, were allowed. Under Phase 3, up to 250 people are now allowed at indoor live performances, in zones of up to 50 people each. The Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay said it is ready for the transition because it has been piloting larger-scale performances since November, after getting the green light from authorities to do so. “As this is something we have been gradually preparing for ... we have not had to make any additional changes to our manpower requirements, capacity limits or seating configurations for our shows next year,” said Rachelle Tan, director of Venues & Planning at the Esplanade. It noted that the live performances it has organised so far have all been well-attended - “an encouraging sign that audiences do cherish the opportunity to return to live arts experiences". The Health Ministry had also earlier said that the capacity for outdoor live performance pilots is being expanded from 100 people to 250 people. This comes after live performances were allowed to resume on Nov 1 and some venues began piloting larger-scale performances.
3,500 madrasah students to benefit from $500,000 Covid-19 disbursement by Muis | SINGAPORE - About 3,500 madrasah students will benefit from a special Covid-19 disbursement of $500,000 from the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) to the six full-time Islamic religious schools. This one-off disbursement, in view of the challenges faced by the madrasah sector during the pandemic, will go towards supporting their student programmes, said Muis on Monday (Dec 28). The six madrasahs are: Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah ($76,459), Madrasah Alsagoff Al-Arabiah ($41,246), Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah ($43,490), Madrasah Irsyad Zuhri Al-Islamiah ($167,649), Madrasah Al-Ma'arif Al-Islamiah ($96,240) and Madrasah Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiah ($74,916). This one-off support will be used for student programmes based on each school's needs, with the quantum based on the enrolment size. Madrasahs, which are private schools, rely heavily on the support of the community, said Muis. They are supported through school fees and grants from various sources such as the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF) as well as government funding. These funds mostly go towards manpower and training expenses. Madrasahs also regularly undertake fund-raising to supplement the shortfall for the school operational and student programme needs. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, several external fund-raising events had to be suspended or cancelled. It was also more difficult for donors to make donations physically. This resulted in a substantial shortfall in revenue from typical fund-raising sources and donation drives, such as collections during Friday congregational prayers, Muis said. In addition, the implementation of safe management measures at the madrasahs has increased their operational costs. Muis had thus earlier worked with the madrasahs to develop and launch the OurMadrasah.sg portal on Dec 4 to raise funds. Over the last few weeks, about $50,000 had been raised through online donations. Calling madrasahs key institutions for the Muslim community, Muis chief executive Esa Masood said: "Our madrasah leaders, teachers and students have adapted well to the challenging situation over the past year and have continued to perform well. "This disbursement signifies Muis' continued support for our madrasahs. We urge the community to rally together and continue to stand in solidarity with our madrasahs so that they can continue the important work to nurture the next generation of asatizah (religious teachers) to guide our community."
CORONAVIRUS/Arrivals from U.K. among 8 new imported COVID-19 cases | Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA) Taiwan recorded eight new imported COVID-19 cases on Monday, including three that arrived from the United Kingdom on the same flight Sunday, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC). The flight was the first from the U.K. to arrive in Taiwan after stricter rules were imposed on travelers from the country. All 114 passengers were tested for COVID-19 shortly after they arrived, and of the group, three have tested positive for the disease, the CECC said. One had a fever, while the other two have shown no symptoms so far, the CECC said. The CECC will discuss further details of the cases at a Monday afternoon press conference
Coronavirus: B.C. confirms first case of COVID-19 variant detected in U.K. | B.C. health officials have confirmed the province’s first case of a coronavirus variant first identified in the U.K. Health officials said Sunday that the case involves a person in the Island Health region, who had recently flown from London to Vancouver on Air Canada flight 855 on Dec. 15. Rows 34 to 40 on the flight are affected, according to a list of exposures on the BC Centre for Disease Control website. The person developed symptoms while in quarantine and was tested immediately, the province said. Testing confirmed the positive diagnosis on Dec. 19. Canada announced a 72-hour ban on incoming flights from the U.K. on Dec. 20. The ban was extended until Jan. 6, 2021. A small number of close contacts are isolating and public health officials are following up with them on a daily basis. The province said a BC CDC lab detected the U.K. variant using whole genome sequencing. “Ongoing review may identify additional cases in the coming days,” the province said. “It is important to note there is no evidence that the new COVID-19 variant is more likely to cause severe illness, nor is there evidence to suggest the Health Canada-approved vaccines will be any less effective against the new variant.” “However, studies suggest the COVID-19 variant first identified in the U.K. can spread more quickly and easily, which is why British Columbians everywhere must continue to be cautious and follow all PHO orders and guidelines, stay close to home, avoid non-essential travel,  practice safe, physical distancing and wear a mask when in public indoor spaces.  Earlier in the day, health officials confirmed a case of the U.K. coronavirus variant in Ottawa, marking the third known case in Canada. That person is now reported to be in self-isolation and contact tracing is underway. Canada’s first two known cases of the variant were confirmed by Ontario involving a couple in Durham Region.

After Threatening To Derail It, Trump Signs COVID-19 Relief Package Into Law | President Trump has signed a massive COVID-19 relief and omnibus spending package, deputy press secretary Judd Deere said Sunday night on Twitter. DON GONYEA, HOST: President Trump has just signed a $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill into law after threatening to derail it. Official confirmation came from a White House tweet in the last half-hour. It came from the press office, not from the president himself. The bill and a larger separate spending measure were approved by big majorities by both houses of the Congress on Monday. NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales is here with us watching all this tonight. Hi, Claudia. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hi, Don. GONYEA: So the president called this package in the past a disgrace, and now we learn he has his signature on it. What do we know about his change of heart? GRISALES: So he did issue a statement tonight. He said he has told Congress that he wants far less wasteful spending and more money going to American people in the form of these larger checks. But with that said, he's going to sign this bill, he said, with plans to go through the bill itself, red line it and turn - cross out items he doesn't like item by item, point out what could be adjusted and plead for them to reconsider this after the fact, after he has signed it. He also said he's signing it because he wants to restore these unemployment benefits that were running out, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, add money for a small business loan program and return airline workers back to work, as well as aid money for vaccine distribution. So he was making clear he realizes now how much was at stake and reversing his position. He also said that he understands the House is going to vote on his demands for new checks in the form of $2,000 to Americans. And now the Senate will also move to try and set up a vote here. We don't expect it to get very far, maybe pass the House, but not in the Senate - Republicans, most of them, still remain opposed. But he had received a lot of pressure from lawmakers, from folks who had pointed out the millions of Americans that would be facing these dire circumstances. These are lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. And unemployment programs, for example, that expired yesterday, adding additional benefits. The eviction moratorium was set to expire Thursday. And then the government was looking at a possible shutdown tomorrow night. GONYEA: OK, so what can Americans expect kind of in the near term? GRISALES: So what they're looking at is to see those direct payments in the coming weeks of up to $600, money for small businesses, vaccine distribution, schools. All told, it's $900 billion. And then there's a $1.4 trillion spending bill that'll keep the government going through September. GONYEA: So - but these lawmakers have to feel like they've just been through whiplash. GRISALES: Exactly. They do. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded this move. I think they're all breathing a sigh of relief tonight because they're not going to have to scramble and face a lot of concerns among millions of Americans. GONYEA: All right. So breaking news tonight. NPR's Claudia Grisales, thank you so much for being on top of it for us. GRISALES: Thank you for having me.
COVID-19: Government sticking to plan for schools to return from next week, Michael Gove tells Sky News | The government is pushing ahead with plans for primary school and older secondary school children to return to classrooms next week - although a senior minister admitted "we always keep things under review".There have been calls for the return of pupils to be delayed after the Christmas holidays, in a bid to cut COVID-19 transmission. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News that the government  remained committed to its plan for pupils to return from 4 January under a staggered schedule. "Our plan is that primary schools will go back but with secondary schools it will be the case that next week only children in Year 11 and Year 13 - those who are doing their GCSEs, their BTECs, their A-levels - those will go back," he said. "And also children of key workers and children who are vulnerable and need the support and care that schools that can provide.Advertisement "Other children in secondary schools won't go back for a week after that." However, asked if the government could be flexible in its plans for schools to return, Mr Gove added: "We always keep things under review but teachers and headteachers have been working incredibly hard over the Christmas period, since schools broke up, in order to prepare for a new testing regime - community testing in order to make sure that children and all of us are safer. "So we do keep things under review but that is the plan."

Covid-19: Hospital pressure and five things to help this winter | Emergency services under pressure as cases rise Hospitals and ambulance services are coming under increased pressure as the new coronavirus variant fuels a rise in infections, health bosses have said. London Ambulance Service received as many emergency calls on Boxing Day as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19, the BBC has learned. The service and at least two others have urged people to call 999 only if there is a serious emergency. And NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said hospitals in London and the south of England were under "real pressure" due to demand from Covid-19 and other conditions, as well as staff absence. 
Trump signs relief and spending package | Donald Trump has signed into law a coronavirus relief and spending package worth $900bn (£665bn), averting a partial government shutdown. The outgoing US president had initially refused to sign the bill, saying he wanted to give people bigger one-off payments. The delay meant that millions of Americans temporarily lost unemployment benefits. Congress approved the stimulus package last week, after months of negotiation. You can read here about how food banks across the country have been straining to meet rising demand during the pandemic, even in some of the country's wealthier regions.
South Africa passes one million infections | South Africa has become the first country on the African continent to register more than one million Covid-19 cases. The grim milestone was reached just days after authorities confirmed that a new, faster-spreading, coronavirus variant had been detected. Some hospitals and medical centres have reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources. President Cyril Ramaphosa is widely expected to announce tougher restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading further. The variant - known as 501.V2 and separate to the one driving infections in the UK - is believed to be behind the surge in cases. Two cases linked to the South African variant were last week detected in the UK.
Doctor 'has shed more tears than ever' | Dr Bethan Gibson says she has shed more tears during the pandemic than in her entire career. The senior intensive care doctor, from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said Wales' lockdown - brought forward by eight days to start on 20 December - was "vital" amid rising critical care numbers. She said the pandemic had been "relentless" on staff, with many taking time off with burnout or stress. But she hopes vaccination will bring some kind of normality by Easter.
Five ways to stay positive through the winter | With Christmas over and the long, dark months upon us, winter can be tough for many of us in normal times - let alone during a pandemic. But the country's leading mental health experts say there are things many of us can do to give ourselves a lift. From moving more to thinking less, here are some of their top tips to stay positive through the winter.
UK poised to approve AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot as need for vaccines grows | LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - Britain is poised to approve the Covid-19 vaccine produced by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, giving the country another powerful tool to fight the pandemic as concern mounts over rising infections. Britain's drug regulator could clear the shot for use as early as this week, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. AstraZeneca chief executive officer Pascal Soriot and British health officials previously said they hoped for approval by the end of the year. The go-ahead would come about three weeks after the Britain became the first Western country to begin vaccinations, using a shot from Pfizer and BioNTech that's been administered to more than 600,000 Britons. Still, virus cases have surged in Britain amid concern about a new strain of the coronavirus that officials have said is more contagious. That prompted the government to reverse plans to ease restrictions over Christmas and tighten lockdowns across large parts of the country. Those measures could be eased at the end of February as the imminent approval of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot permits the vaccination of as many as 15 million of the country's most vulnerable people, the Mail on Sunday reported. The country's health service would no longer be at risk of being overwhelmed by virus cases once that threshold is met, the newspaper said. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will need time to carry out a review of the vaccine data, the Department of Health and Social Care said by e-mail. Representatives for the MHRA and AstraZeneca declined to comment. The AstraZeneca vaccine could facilitate a rapid ramp-up of vaccinations because it is easier to transport and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, requiring only refrigerator temperatures rather than deep freezing. It is also less expensive to produce, so many developing countries - along with the United States and the European Union - have also signed deals for doses. The vaccine could be rolled out across Britain from Jan 4, the Sunday Telegraph reported. British approval would provide vindication for the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot, which has been slowed by questions about discrepancies in the trial results. Overall, these studies showed that the vaccine was less effective than shots from Pfizer and another developer, Moderna. But a subset of the trial that showed better results resulted from a dosing mistake. Britain has more riding on the domestically developed shot than the US and some other countries because it won't be able to get any of the Moderna vaccine until well into next year. Mr Soriot told the Sunday Times that new data will show the AstraZeneca vaccine is comparable to the 95 per cent effectiveness rate reported by the rival developers. "We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else," he told the newspaper. "I can't tell you more because we will publish at some point." Mr Soriot previously said the vaccine was on track for large-scale vaccinations by the end of the year. England's chief medical officer, Dr Chris Whitty, had said he expected the MHRA to act by early next year or perhaps sooner. The final cut of data was submitted to regulators last Monday and the National Health Service has enlisted more than 10,000 medics and volunteers to administer the shot, the Telegraph reported. Mass vaccination centres at sports stadiums and conference venues are expected to begin in the second week of January, according to the paper. Government officials will hold a meeting on the pandemic on Monday after scientists warned that school closures may be necessary to slow the spread of the new Covid-19 variant, the newspaper said. The country has been one of the hardest hit in Europe with more than 70,000 deaths, the most in the region after Italy. Much of Britain has been moved into the harshest Tier 4 restrictions, which prohibit household mixing and forced the closing of pubs, restaurants and many businesses, after the discovery earlier this month of the more contagious strain.
Transformative Post-COVID-19 Trends and Growth Opportunities in ASEAN | Macroeconomic Growth Opportunities in Post-COVID-19 ASEAN covers the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on the economy of 4 countries—Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by World Health Organization on 11 March, 2020 and is expected to severely impact the global economy. As of early June, 2020, there were more than 6 million positive cases of coronavirus and Thailand was the first country outside China to announce positive cases (on 13 January 2020). The study forecasts the recovery scenario of each country’s economy. It identifies aviation and tourism as the worst-hit sectors, due to global restrictions in movements. The impact has been positive on the ICT and medical devices industries, with a sudden spike in demand. The study outlines the corresponding economic trends and forecasts for the ASEAN countries.Various strategic imperatives have been discussed, explaining how the countries can combat COVID-19. Impact of the oil price war inflicted by oil-importing countries in mid-April has also been analyzed.All 4 countries have announced various stimulus packages worth billions of dollars over the course of the last few months to stabilize the economy. These packages were primarily directed toward saving and creating jobs, supporting SMEs, and helping individuals and households. The study also highlights the important monetary policy measures taken by the countries during COVID-19.Major shifts in workforce, consumer behavior, and consumer spending have been witnessed, due to the pandemic. As a result, unemployment and poverty in underdeveloped and developing countries are additional concerns. A new normal in each country is set to follow post COVID-19, includes wearing masks and maintaining social distance.Many countries are opening up their economy in phases, with strict regulations in place. Essential services, food outlets, and retail stores starting their businesses first. However, aviation and tourism are yet to pick up, as global movements are still restricted across countries. Most of the flights in operation are repatriation flights bringing back native citizens from various countries.The analyst continues to track market developments across sectors and geographies.
Wolverhampton councillor charged over alleged Covid-19 grant fraud | Wolverhampton councillor Harman Banger will appear at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court over two offences between March 11 and June 5. The case was first heard by the Black Country Magistrates Court on December 22 where it was adjourned until January 11 next year. Banger, of Bilston Road, is accused of committing fraud by dishonestly making a false representation, a court listing said. It is alleged the 39-year-old, who faces two charges, did so to obtain a £10,000 grant under the Government's Covid-19 Small Business Scheme. The court document alleges that "between 11/03/2020 and 05/06/2020 at Wolverhampton in the county of West Midlands, committed fraud in that you dishonestly made a false representation, namely obtain £10,000 pounds grant under the UK Government Covid-19 Small Business Scheme, intending to cause loss to Wolverhampton Council or to expose that person to a risk of loss, for yourself. Contrary to sections 1 and 2 of the Fraud Act 2006." Labour councillor Banger, who represents East Park on the city council, stood down from his role as the city's economy cabinet member after the allegations emerged in June this year. He was arrested by West Midlands Police in June and was released pending a full probe. He has also been administratively suspended from the Labour group in the city pending the outcome of an internal party investigation. Neena Kumari, 37 and also of Bilston Road, has also been charged with the two offences.
COVID-19 Relief Package: Many Families Depending On Expanded Unemployment Benefits | NEW BRIGHTON (KDKA) – President Donald Trump ultimately ended up signing a COVID-19 relief bill that will restore unemployment benefits along with other relief measures. However, his late-night signature still doesn’t negate that pandemic unemployment benefits from the CARES Act expired on Sunday morning. While some relief seems to be on the way, the pandemic has been incredibly difficult on many people financially, including Lora and Jason Clewes. They live in New Brighton with their kids and they have been out of work. “I feel like we really need the unemployment support more than anything,” Lora Clewes said. “I need longevity. I need stability. I need to know my kids are going to be okay. I’m doing the best that I can. My husband is doing the best he can while he’s injured. We just need that support.” Lora is a waitress who has been laid off due to the restrictions on indoor dining throughout Pennsylvania and her husband Jason is out of work because of his health. He says he needs surgery before he’s cleared to work, a procedure that has been put on hold due to the pandemic. Their expanded unemployment assistance experience earlier in the month, making life incredibly difficult. Lora said they’re suffering and after going without income for the past few weeks, extended unemployment benefits will be a relief. According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s November unemployment report said 10.7 million Americans are unemployed and 2.8 were temporarily laid off – both numbers represent a decrease from October.
Aussie golf great Norman returns to hospital for Covid-19 treatment | Australian golf legend Greg Norman returned to hospital for further treatment after testing positive for Covid-19, saying on Instagram he hoped it was his "final update on this Covid saga." Norman had spent Friday in hospital after experiencing coronavirus symptoms, but the 65-year-old Aussie, a former world number one who won the 1986 and 1983 British Opens, said on Instagram on Saturday he had returned home and was quarantining in his guest house in Jupiter, Florida. Once his positive test was confirmed, Norman said Sunday, he returned to the hospital to receive antibody infusion treatment but hoped to be back home later in the day. Norman urged his social media followers to take the virus seriously. "I am fit and strong and have a high tolerance for pain but this virus kicked the crap out of me like nothing I have ever experienced before," he wrote. "Muscle and joint pain on another level. Headaches that feel like a chisel going through your head ... Then my taste failed where beer tastes bad and wine the same. And finally at times struggling with memory of names and things. So please take care." Norman competed in last week's PNC Championship in Orlando with his son Greg Jr., testing negative for the virus both before and after the event.
South Korea to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine efforts as first UK variant detected | SEOUL: South Korean officials are vowing to speed up efforts to launch a public COVID-19 vaccination programme as the country on Monday (Dec 28) announced it had detected its first cases of the coronavirus variant linked to the rapid rise in infections in Britain. The new variant, thought to be more transmissible than others currently circulating, was found in three people who had entered South Korea from London on Dec 22, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Monday. They have been placed in isolation since testing positive for COVID-19 on arrival, said the KDCA. South Korea will extend a ban on direct flights from Britain for another week until Jan 7, and will require any passengers arriving from that country or South Africa to undergo testing before departure, officials announced on Monday. The new coronavirus strain emerged earlier this month in Britain and has already reached several European countries, as well as Canada, Jordan and Japan. The new strain, which experts fear is more contagious, prompted more than 50 countries to impose travel restrictions on Britain. South Korea was among them and has barred flights from Britain until the end of the year. South Korean authorities are also looking into the case of an elderly South Korean man who posthumously tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from Britain earlier this month. Overall the KDCA reported 808 new cases as of midnight Sunday, the lowest since a record 1,241 infections were logged on Friday. Authorities cautioned that the drop may be due to less testing done over the weekend and the Christmas holiday, and said on Sunday they would be extending social distancing measures until early January. South Korea's government has faced mounting domestic criticism over its vaccine procurement and rollout plans, which call for the first vaccinations to begin in the first quarter of next year, months after places such as the United States and the European Union. Negative views of the vaccine plans was one of the leading reasons that drove President Moon Jae-in's disapproval rating to an all-time high of nearly 60 per cent, pollster Realmeter said on Monday. Regulators will shorten the period required to approve vaccines and treatments from and average of 180 days to as little as 40 days, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced on Sunday. An additional approval process for the distribution and sale of vaccines, which usually takes several months, will be shortened to around 20 days, the ministry said. Medical workers and elderly residents will begin receiving the vaccinations in February, and plans to vaccinate the broader public are accelerating, Moon said on Monday. "There are concerns that our country hasn't secured enough vaccines or that the vaccinations will be delayed. This is not true," Moon told a meeting with his top aides, according to a statement. "We are making efforts to advance the timeline for adopting vaccines." South Korea has said it plans to buy enough doses to eventually vaccinate 46 million people, or more than 85 per cent of its population. Presidential chief of staff Noh Young-min said authorities expected South Korea's population to reach a level of herd immunity through the vaccines as fast or faster than many other countries. South Korea has reported a total of 57,680 coronavirus cases, with 819 deaths. 
Golf: Norman back in hospital after testing positive for COVID-19 | Greg Norman is back in hospital in Florida after the Australian golfing great tested positive for COVID-19, the 65-year-old said late on Sunday. REUTERS: Greg Norman is back in hospital in Florida after the Australian golfing great tested positive for COVID-19, the 65-year-old said late on Sunday. Norman, whose two major titles came at the British Open in 1986 and 1993, had said he tested negative at the exhibition PNC Championship in Orlando from Dec. 19-20 but began to experience fever, joint and muscle aches later in the week. He went into hospital on Christmas Day and returned home to self-isolate on Saturday while awaiting the results of another test. "I hope this will be my final update on this COVID saga ... back in hospital after getting a positive result," he said on Instagram, adding he was receiving an infusion of antibodies. "The path to full recovery. Hoping to be out later today." Norman said that despite being fit and strong and having a high tolerance for pain, the "hideous" virus had "kicked the crap out of me like nothing I have ever experienced before". "Muscle and joint pain on another level. Headaches that feel like a chisel going through your head scraping little bits off each time, fever, muscles that just did not want to work," he added. "Then my taste failed, where beer tastes bad and wine the same ... at times struggling with memory of names and things." Norman's son, also named Greg, had played with his father at the PNC Championship and has already confirmed he and his wife had tested positive.
Sen. Mitch McConnell commends President Trump’s decision to sign COVID-19 relief legislation | President Donald Trump signed the COVID-19 relief and government funding legislation Sunday evening. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded the President’s decision to sign the legislation, “I thank the President for signing this relief into law, along with full-year government funding legislation that will continue the rebuilding and modernization of our Armed Forces that his Administration has championed,” said McConnell. “His leadership has prevented a government shutdown at a time when our nation could not have afforded one.” 
Mainland China reports 21 new Covid-19 cases vs 22 a day earlier | [SHANGHAI] Mainland China reported 21 new Covid-19 cases on Dec 27, down from 22 cases a day earlier, the country's national health authority said on Monday. The National Health Commission, in a statement, said 15 of the new cases were imported infections originating from overseas.
Little risk of Covid-19 infection from staying at hotels with guests on SHN, say experts | SINGAPORE - There will inevitably be more imported Covid-19 cases here, but experts say this will not be of great concern. They noted that more travellers are returning during the festive period, especially since the outbreak in some countries is worsening during winter. Case numbers could rise if border restrictions are eased in the coming months. Imported cases have increased from single to double digits in the past two weeks, with 21 new infections last Wednesday (Dec 23). The number of people serving stay-home notice (SHN) in hotels has also risen in tandem. People taking staycations do not need to worry about getting infected if they book a hotel that also serves those on SHN, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. "Generally, hotels hosting SHN travellers are required to practise certain protocols, especially in ensuring that SHN travellers and holidaying guests do not mingle," Prof Teo said. "This may mean that SHN travellers are housed in a dedicated wing or on dedicated floors." If protocols are followed properly, the chance of holidaying guests being infected by SHN travellers is very small, he added. Prof Teo's remarks follow the recent Mandarin Orchard hotel incident, where 13 people were suspected to have contracted the virus while on SHN. "But I expect this likelihood to be even much smaller now, since I'm sure the authorities are reviewing the protocols for hotels that serve both SHN travellers and holidaying guests," Prof Teo said. But there is a need to understand how the incident happened to prevent a recurrence, he added, noting: "This is the nature with operations, and there will be gaps that will emerge from time to time, and the important thing here is to have a system to look out for these gaps, so they can be plugged and addressed when they occur." Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious diseases physician at Rophi Clinic in Gleneagles Hospital, echoed similar views, noting that staff serving SHN guests do not serve ordinary guests at the same time. "SHNs and guests on staycations are completely segregated... shared staff will serve SHNs on a single shift or rotation... and then serve non-SHNs," Dr Ling said. "As long as everyone continues to be responsible at all levels, we can continue to accommodate both SHNs and regular guests in a safe manner." Professor Dale Fisher, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the National University Hospital, noted that such hotels are potential hot spots so procedures are critical to ensure separation from those enjoying staycations. "The Mandarin Orchard hotel event suggests that there was an infection control breach where spread occurred between travellers (but not to others), a risk that is always present," Prof Fisher said. "We have also seen breaches in Australia and most recently in Taiwan, where an imported case has caused local transmission." Prof Fisher added: "I am not concerned over staycations. The threat is obvious and hotels would doubtless ensure segregation of travellers from staycationers. And this case was not that. It was between travellers, so understanding how this could have happened is what is important now. "This incident is a reminder that quarantine facilities... are our first line of defence from what is happening beyond our borders. The second line is what we do as a community within Singapore with distancing, masks and avoiding large groups." Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the incident also shows the value of genomic sequencing as it can uncover possible links between cases. The Mandarin Orchard hotel cases, who came from 10 different countries, were infected by coronavirus strains with high genetic similarity, implying the infections may have come from one source. "Without genomic sequencing, we'd have been none the wiser about this cluster. It was quite self-contained, there's so far no evidence of it having spilled over from the guests and staff to others in the community," Prof Cook said. 
Unknown how rapidly new COVID-19 variant might spread in B.C.: epidemiologist | Daniel Coombs, an epidemiologist at the ­University of British Columbia, said he’s surprised to see the presence of the U.K. variant of COVID-19 on Vancouver Island, which has had relatively limited spread of the virus. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been mutating throughout the months of the pandemic but this new variant, called B.1.1.7, has been mutating quicker than expected. It has multiple spike protein mutations that have made it 70 per cent more transmissible than previous variants, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  Coombs said it remains to be seen how the new variant will affect B.C.’s R rate, which is the number of people to whom one infected person will pass on the virus. The U.K. government said last week the new variant could increase the virus reproduction R rate by 0.4, from 1.1 to 1.5. B.C.’s R rate is currently 0.9. Coombs said the R rate is determined by how contagious the disease is and the behaviour of people, so public health measures like social distancing and a ban on social gatherings can keep transmission down. B.1.1.7 was spreading for months in the U.K. undetected, Coombs said. Canada, he said, has the benefit of more knowledge and research to influence individual behaviour and government policies. He also pointed out that B.C.’s daily COVID-19 case numbers have been trending downward, which has not been the case in the U.K. “It does remain to be seen if it will spread more rapidly in Canada or in B.C.” Coombs said. The variant has caused record numbers of COVID-19 infections in the United Kingdom, and Canada has put in place a ban on all flights arriving from the U.K. However, the variant has spread to other European countries, as well as Australia and Japan, and without a wider ban on international flights, it will likely continue to spread in Canada, Coombs said. If the U.K. strain does prove to be highly transmissible in Canada, it will mean the process of vaccinating enough people to stop the spread of COVID-19 will take longer, Coombs said. That could mean the country will need at least 70 per cent of the population to receive the virus to create herd immunity, he said. B.C.’s Ministry of Health has not announced new COVID-19 restrictions in light of the presence of the new variant. 
Coronavirus Australia news: Dozen fines issued for northern beaches COVID-19 breach at Sydney wedding reception | A Chinese court handed a four-year jail term on Monday (December 28) to a citizen-journalist who reported from the central city of Wuhan at the peak of last year's coronavirus outbreak, on grounds of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," her lawyer said. Zhang Zhan, 37, the first such person known to have been tried, was among a handful of people whose firsthand accounts from crowded hospitals and empty streets painted a more dire picture of the pandemic epicenter than the official narrative. In Shanghai, police enforced tight security outside the court where the trial opened seven months after Zhang's detention, although some supporters were undeterred. Criticism of China's early handling of the crisis has been censored, and whistle-blowers, such as doctors, warned. State media have credited success in reining in the virus to the leadership of President Xi Jinping. The virus has spread worldwide to infect more than 80 million people and kill over 1.76 million, paralyzing air travel as nations threw up barriers against it that have disrupted industries and livelihoods.

How Whitfield County became one of Georgia's worst COVID-19 hot spots | (CNN)As we head into the next chapter of an ongoing pandemic — one in which a vaccine will hopefully let us see a light at the end of the tunnel — we must be careful not to ease up on the precautionary measures that will keep us safe while we wait for immunity.As infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said last month, "If you are fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don't stop shooting until the cavalry gets here."Thankfully, the Biden-Harris transition team has already released an initial Covid-19 plan and named its own team in charge of the pandemic response, with Fauci serving as a chief medical adviser. However, these initial efforts are lacking in two significant ways. First, although the plan addresses mask wearing and physical distancing as part of a broad "evidence-based guidance for how communities should navigate the pandemic," it doesn't emphasize the federal government's role in creating its own educational program and directing messages broadly to the American public.Second, the expertise of the 16-member pandemic response team named by President-elect Joe Biden is impressive, but the group consists mainly of medical doctors (nine in total). Two members have a background in the world of public health and supervise health communication efforts, but the task force does not include a single member whose primary training and expertise is in the behavioral or social sciences, or in public health education or communication. To date, there has not been a concerted national educational campaign to inform and persuade Americans with consistent messages about the crucial need for physical distancing, wearing masks and other measures that can help stop the spread of Covid-19. The task of educating the public about disease prevention has been left largely to the media, individual states and local jurisdictions, leading to contradictory measures. The messaging depends heavily on location and the political whims of the people in charge. Political battles, at times, have seemed to take priority over simple prevention measures that could save thousands of lives.The early efforts by the Biden-Harris team are encouraging, and the incoming administration has begun to plan "how to communicate in the most creative, transparent and effective ways to reach Americans where they are." But mounting the formidable battle against the spread of the virus requires a comprehensive, national campaign that spells out in simple terms — with consistent, engaging, and compelling messages — a crucial point that the Trump administration was not willing to articulate: Covid-19 is preventable and can be eradicated if each of us engages consistently in preventive practices and if we pursue testing after a possible exposure.As we know from fighting other deadly viruses and diseases, including HIV, those behaviors must be promoted and reinforced on an ongoing basis, including by those in positions of leadership at the national level.  The arrival of a vaccine will only heighten the importance of public health education. Now that the US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency authorization to the first two vaccines — developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — national efforts to educate the general public about Covid-19 vaccination will quickly become an urgent need. Messages about the advantages of vaccination, the vaccine's safety and efficacy, and which groups should seek to be vaccinated and when, will be essential. After all, the success of vaccination presupposes that people are motivated to seek it out. This national prevention, education and awareness campaign would strengthen measures being promoted at the state and local levels. It could encourage Americans to feel a strong sense of moral responsibility to care for one another — just the opposite of what we heard from President Donald Trump, who, in effect, launched his own personal, national campaign against mask wearing by refusing to wear a mask, allowing his supporters to rally without them, and even mocking Biden for wearing one. (From time to time, Trump has been somewhat more supportive of masks, but his message has remained largely inconsistent.)A national campaign would help offset the information (or lack thereof) in those states where governors have been reluctant to promote masks, model their use or make it mandatory to wear them in public places.In Taiwan, one of the countries with the highest rates of success in controlling Covid-19, a national educational program has been credited with reinforcing a high rate of compliance with mask wearing, as part of a broad strategy that also addresses medical and cultural issues, as well as social disparities.To date, Taiwan has had just 785 Covid-19 cases, a stark contrast to the more than 19 million infections in the United States, where the whopping 5,812 cases per 100,000 people is close to 2,000 times larger. Granted, Taiwan is much smaller than the US and has different social conditions. But the point is that from the early days of the pandemic, its government recognized the value of a national educational program to prevent the spread of Covid-19, which has allowed the country to simultaneously protect its economy. By themselves, national public health education campaigns are no panacea, but they can be important components in the toolkit of prevention measures. 
Singapore panel recommends maximum level of Covid-19 vaccine coverage | SINGAPORE - An expert committee convened by Singapore’s health ministry has recommended all residents medically eligible for Covid-19 vaccination to take shots as they become available, although it said vaccination should remain a voluntary option. The recommendation comes as Singapore’s success in controlling the virus makes some question whether they should take the jabs. The city-state has been reporting almost zero new local cases daily over the last few weeks. The expert committee, convened in October, recommended achieving as high a level of population coverage for Covid-19 vaccination as possible to reduce the overall proportion of the population that is susceptible to the disease and the likelihood of uncontrolled chains of transmission, a statement on Sunday said. Singapore has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, the first batch of which arrived on Dec 21. The vaccine was also independently reviewed and backed by the committee. Singapore has signed advanced purchase agreements and made early downpayments on several vaccine candidates, including those being developed by Moderna and Sinovac. It expects to have enough vaccines for all 5.7 million people by the third quarter of 2021. The government has said the vaccines will be free, voluntary and given first to healthcare workers and the elderly. On Sunday, the health ministry said vaccinations for healthcare workers would begin on Dec 30 and that it aimed to begin vaccinating the elderly, starting with those aged 70 years and above, from February. The country on Monday will move into its third phase of reopening when it lifts more anti-virus curbs, including allowing groups of eight to congregate in public, up from a limit of five, and increase capacity limits for large gatherings. “While the current number of cases in the community remains low, the risk for further importation of Covid-19 and community spread will increase as we move into phase three and given the global Covid-19 situation,” the health ministry said, adding that it accepted the committee’s various recommendations.
Mediacorp drops Sonia Chew as countdown show host amid Covid-19 probe | Mediacorp radio DJ Sonia Chew has been pulled from hosting its annual countdown show in the wake of investigations against her for allegedly breaching safe distancing measures. In a statement to The New Paper yesterday, a Mediacorp spokesman confirmed that Jean Danker will be hosting Let's Celebrate 2021 instead. Ms Chew was initially slated to host the event with fellow 987FM DJ Joakim Gomez. The duo were supposed to usher in the new year on the show, which will be screened online and on Mediacorp's channels. However, Ms Chew recently found herself a subject of investigations by the Ministry of National Development (MND), after complaints were made about a photo of a large group celebrating Mediacorp artiste Jeffrey Xu's 32nd birthday. The photo was posted on Mr Xu's account on Oct 3, and shows a group of 13 people in a private residence. Ms Chew was in the picture with other celebrities, including Shane Pow and Terence Cao. Investigations are ongoing. A Mediacorp spokesman told TNP it takes the matter seriously and constantly reminds its artistes to adhere to safe management guidelines. He added that Mr Gomez will still host the event alongside Ms Danker. "Filming for Let's Celebrate 2021 was conducted in accordance with IMDA (Infocomm Media Development Authority) guidelines, which allows no more than 20 onscreen talents unmasked during production," he said. "We would like to assure you that safety remains a priority, and that safe management measures are in place for Let's Celebrate 2021." Ms Chew posted an apology on Instagram over the weekend, saying she was invited to have drinks and was not aware it was a birthday celebration. Calling it a "severe lapse of judgment" on her part, she added it has been a tough time for her family to witness how distraught she has been. The radio presenter, who turns 29 today, is also featured in campaigns linked to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). This includes the SingapoRediscovers campaign by Klook, which features her promoting heritage tours and tourism locations. When contacted, Klook declined to comment. Ms Chew was also recently involved in a campaign by Sentosa, and was featured in commercials on Mediacorp's free-to-air platforms. TNP understands the commercials featuring her have ended, and Sentosa is looking into the matter with Mediacorp.
Beijing tightens Covid-19 curbs as local transmissions continue | BEIJING: Beijing has tightened Covid-19 curbs over concerns that China's mass travel during the holiday period could cause cases to spike in the capital, as it reported locally transmitted cases for a fourth straight day yesterday. Of the 12 locally transmitted cases yesterday, five were in Beijing's Shunyi district. A meeting led by the capital's Communist party boss, Mr Cai Qi, urged all districts in Beijing to enter an "emergency" mode, sealing off residential compounds and villages where infections are found. China's southern technology hub of Shenzhen reported one asymptomatic case yesterday, a patient who made two business trips to Beijing this month. Shunyi has declared a wartime mode and testing for all its 800,000 people. All the cases reported on Saturday were close contacts of previous cases. Two villages in Shunyi have been sealed off. The Chinese authorities plan to vaccinate 50 million people in high-risk groups before the Chinese New Year holidays from Feb 11, said state media Global Times. Beijing has asked its civil servants to stay in the city from Jan 1 until the holidays and asked the public to avoid unnecessary travel during the period. Public venues such as theme parks and churches have scaled back operating hours. Some Catholic churches in Beijing have stopped admitting churchgoers and halted group activities. Commercial performances have been banned from Jan 1 until the holidays. Meanwhile, South Korea said yesterday that it will extend social distancing measures introduced to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus for another six days, to Jan 3, even as it continues to report near-record numbers of new cases each day. For the run-up to Christmas and New Year holidays, the government banned gatherings of more than four people in greater Seoul and closed down ski resorts and other tourist spots. Beyond that temporary restriction, gatherings of more than 50 people are banned in greater Seoul and indoor restaurant dining is prohibited after 9pm local time. "We will observe the situation over the next week and decide whether to adjust the social distancing measures before Jan 3 when the special quarantine measures for the year-end holidays terminate," Health Minister Kwon Deok-cheol said at a briefing. The country reported 970 new coronavirus cases for Saturday, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said earlier yesterday, bringing the national tally to 56,872 cases, with 808 deaths. That is the smallest in five days but still not far off the record 1,241 infections logged on Friday. In Australia, Sydney's outbreak continued yesterday with more than a quarter million people in lockdown as the country's largest city awaited word on whether any public New Year's Eve celebrations will be allowed. Seven cases of the new coronavirus were reported in the New South Wales state, six linked directly to the outbreak in Sydney's northern beach suburbs, which are under a stay-at-home order until Wednesday. Infections have passed 120. 
San Diego County Reports 3,132 New COVID-19 Infections, No New Deaths | San Diego County public health officials have reported 3,132 new COVID-19 infections — the 27th consecutive day with more than 1,000 cases. On Sunday, there were no new virus-related deaths reported. Sunday was the 19th day with more than 2,000 new cases. Another 50 people also were hospitalized, according to Sunday's data, and another seven patients were sent to intensive care units. The county's cumulative cases increased to 145,779 and the death toll remained at 1,402. Ten new community outbreaks were confirmed on Saturday. There have been 60 confirmed outbreaks in the last seven days and 250 cases associated with those outbreaks. A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days. A complete list of county COVID-19 testing sites, how to make appointments and hours can be found online. Though county officials advised residents to avoid holiday gatherings, anyone who participated in a gathering was urged to get tested, as well as people who recently returned from travel, people with any symptoms and people at higher risk for COVID-19, whether or not they display symptoms. In advising against holiday gatherings, San Diego County Supervisors Nathan Fletcher and Greg Cox pointed to a massive uptick in cases after Thanksgiving — including the region's highest daily total coming three weeks after the holiday with 3,611 cases reported last Friday. "We cannot ignore the reality that we are in a bad place right now," Cox said. "We're making a special plea to avoid large gatherings with those outside your immediate family. This one time, this one year." If people have already traveled, they should be extra cautious about spreading the virus, Cox said. According to Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer, 44.1% of the county's cumulative cases have been reported after Thanksgiving. San Diego County is on pace to report another 600 deaths due to the virus before the end of January, she said. "We don't want to see what happened after Thanksgiving happen again," Wooten said. "We must continue to stay apart to get the spread of the virus under control. If we don't, cases, hospitalizations and deaths will continue to soar." The 11-county Southern California region is still reporting zero available ICU beds. Current stay-at-home orders took effect at 11:59 Dec. 6, and were originally set to end on Monday. 
Commentary: How a catchphrase shaped Japan’s COVID-19 response - for the better | TOKYO: Sometimes, when Japanese academics select the single written character that best captures the essence of the year gone by, there are surprises. In 2020, there could only be one choice: Mitsu, meaning “close”, “intimate” or “dense”. The selection attests to a word whose usage has been recast by COVID-19. Nearly a year into the pandemic, the process of that recasting has been vital. It places Japan in a group with Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam and China, as theories form about the societal factors that might have contributed to keeping their infection and death rates comparatively low. Early in the crisis, as governments strained to find public health strategies that had the magic combination of being coherent and achievable, Tokyo began urging people to fear and avoid three mitsu — close-contact settings, tightly packed crowds and confined environments. The slogan proved linguistically and socially potent. A word that had previously conveyed a warm and intimate sense of closeness suddenly implied something claustrophobic and abhorrent. While public health messaging by other nations was often ruinously contorted, mitsu was a triumph. It simply classified the biggest risks and then guessed (for the most part correctly) that a society already disposed to generating and self-policing new rules would do just that. Investors, suggest analysts at Nomura Securities in an unusual report entitled “Discipline delivers”, should view the success as a reason for a wholesale reassessment of regional risk. The report attempts to frame Japan’s response to the pandemic (along with those of other Asian countries where deaths per million have been low) with a distinction between “tight” and “loose” cultures of individualism versus collectivism. To do this, joint head of Asia Pacific equity research, Jim McCafferty, and his colleagues drew on a striking breadth of sociological, anthropological and psychological scholarship. Conservative attitudes in Asian societies, the report concludes, “are mirrored in the behaviours of listed companies and governments”. As end-of-year equity research reports go, this is a courageous way to punt stocks. The report starts with the premise that COVID-19 management strategies in Asia have generally had a better record of success than in other parts of the world, notably the US and UK. For a start, it looks at the background to Taiwan’s effective containment of the virus without resorting to a national lockdown. In 2003, when Taiwan was hit by the SARS outbreak, complacency and dismissal of guidelines led to panic and hoarding. In the wake of that, argues Ming-Cheng Lo at the University of California, the crisis was “societalised”. The problem was reinterpreted as a societal crisis. When COVID-19 arrived, there was still a strong national memory that these threats had to be dealt with as a society. A similar phenomenon followed South Korea’s experience with MERS in 2015. One of the most important metrics to explain cultural differences in social behaviour is the variation in the balance between individualism and collectivism. Japan, Hong Kong, China and South Korea sit at the collective end of the scale, whereas most western nations are further towards the individualistic end. Collectivist societies — where unwritten rules often carry significant weight — are thought to be more conformist and therefore better at solving problems like a pandemic. A high degree of conformity, the report notes, is the main reason why Asian societies behave in a more orderly way than those in the west: Individuals cede greater importance to the group and the clan has a strong power of regulation of people’s behaviour. A final observation highlights the theory of cultural “tightness” and “looseness” that reflects the power of social norms — such as the wearing of masks or the avoidance of mitsu — and how societies go about sanctioning them. A 33-nation survey conducted by psychologist Michele Gelfand produced national “tightness scores” based on how appropriate participants in a given country felt certain behaviours (laughing, kissing, arguing and so on) were in different contexts (in libraries, at funerals, on buses). China, Singapore, South Korea and Japan score highly. Nomura’s report brings all this, screechingly but plausibly, back to equities. The Asian response to the pandemic should pose much tougher questions about whether the country risk premiums currently applied by global fund managers (which give a higher score to China and Japan than to the UK and France) are still valid, says Mr McCafferty. If a word like mitsu can change its meaning overnight, what else might be due a re-rating?
Austin-Travis County reports 216 new COVID-19 cases, 1 new death | As of Sunday evening, there have been 48,424 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus) in Austin/Travis County since the pandemic began --- one new death was reported, bringing the total at 532. The City of Austin released the new numbers on its COVID-19 website -- it said there are 4,411 active cases. It's estimated over 43,400 people have recovered. Hospital admissions were also reported, bringing that total to 404 -- 136 of those are in intensive care and 70 are on ventilators. 
Europe rolls out 'new weapon' vaccines in bid to slay COVID-19 | MADRID: Europe launched a mass COVID-19 vaccination drive on Sunday (Dec 27) with pensioners and medics lining up to get the first shots to see off a pandemic that has crippled economies and claimed more than 1.7 million lives worldwide. "Thank God," 96-year-old Araceli Hidalgo said as she became the first person in Spain to have a vaccine at her care home in Guadalajara, near the capital Madrid. "Let's see if we can make this virus go away." In Italy, the first country in Europe to record significant numbers of infections, 29-year-old nurse Claudia Alivernini was one of three medical staff at the head of the queue for the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. "It is the beginning of the end ... it was an exciting, historic moment," she said at Rome's Spallanzani hospital. The region of 450 million people is trying to catch up with the United States and Britain, which have already started vaccinations using the Pfizer shot. The European Union is due to receive 12.5 million doses by the end of the year, enough to vaccinate 6.25 million people based on the two-dose regimen. The companies are scrambling to meet global demand and aim to make 1.3 billion shots next year. The bloc has secured contracts with a range of drugmakers besides Pfizer, including Moderna and AstraZeneca , for a total of more than two billion vaccine doses and has set a goal for all adults to be inoculated during 2021. With surveys pointing to high levels of hesitancy towards the vaccine in countries from France to Poland, leaders of the 27-country European Union are promoting it as the best chance of getting back to something like normal life next year. "We have a new weapon against the virus: The vaccine. We must stand firm, once more," tweeted French President Emmanuel Macron, who tested positive for the coronavirus this month and left quarantine on Christmas Eve. But Ireneusz Sikorski, 41, leaving church in the Polish capital of Warsaw, was sceptical. "I don't think there's a vaccine in history that has been tested so quickly," he said. "I am not saying vaccination shouldn't be taking place. But I am not going to test an unverified vaccine on my children, or on myself." Distribution of the shot presents tough challenges as the vaccine uses new mRNA technology and must be stored at about -70 degrees Celsius. In Germany, the campaign faced delays in several cities after a temperature tracker showed that about 1,000 shots may not have been kept cold enough during transit. BioNTech said it was responsible for the shipment to the 25 German distribution centres and that the federal states and local authorities were responsible for the shipment to the vaccination centres and the mobile vaccination teams. "This is where the variations in temperature occurred. We are in contact with many authorities to provide advice, however it is up to them how to proceed," a spokeswoman said. The Pfizer shots being used in Europe were shipped from its factory in Puurs, Belgium, in specially designed containers filled with dry ice. They can be stored for up to six months at Antarctic winter temperatures, or for five days at 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius, a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals. In Italy, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers - a symbol of spring - sprouted in town squares as the vaccination drive kicked off. Portugal has been establishing separate cold storage units for its Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores. At the Santa Maria hospital in Portugal's capital Lisbon, Pedro Pires waited for a shot with other nurses at the end of an overnight shift. "It has been tiring," he told Reuters. Branka Anicic, an 81-year-old resident of a care home in Zagreb, became the first person to get a shot in Croatia. "I'm happy I will now be able to see my great-grandchildren," she said. German pilot Samy Kramer celebrated the vaccination campaign by tracing out a giant syringe in the sky. He flew 200km, following a syringe-shaped route that showed up on internet site flightradar24. The vaccination drive is all the more urgent because of the concern around new variants of the virus linked to a rapid expansion of cases in Britain and South Africa. "We know that the pandemic won't just disappear as of today, but the vaccine is the beginning of the victory over the pandemic, the vaccine is a 'game changer'," said Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Cases of the UK variant have been detected in Australia, Hong Kong and in Europe, mostly recently in Sweden, France, Norway and Portugal's island of Madeira. So far, scientists say there is no evidence to suggest the vaccines developed will be any less effective against the new variants. While Europe has some of the best-resourced healthcare systems in the world, the scale of the effort means some countries are calling on retired medics to help while others have loosened rules for who is allowed to give the injections. Beyond hospitals and care homes, sports halls and convention centres left vacant by lockdown restrictions will become venues for mass inoculations. Vaccinations also started in Norway, which is not a member of the EU bloc. "I feel like a historical figure ... almost like the first man on the Moon," said care home resident Svein Andersen, 67, as he received the country's first shot in the capital, Oslo. After European governments were criticised for failing to work together to counter the spread of the virus in early 2020, the goal this time is to ensure that there is equal access across the region. But even then, Hungary on Saturday jumped the gun on the official roll-out by administering shots to frontline workers at hospitals in the capital Budapest. The Netherlands said it will not start vaccinating until Jan 8. Slovakia also went ahead with some inoculations of healthcare staff on Saturday and in Germany, a small number of people at a care home were inoculated a day early too. "We don't want to waste that one day that the vaccine loses shelf life," Karsten Fischer, from the pandemic staff of the Harz district in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, told broadcaster MDR. 
'I try to forget': Emotional scars remain for some who lived through Wuhan's COVID-19 lockdown | WUHAN, China: It's been almost a year, but the Koh family still remembers vividly their disbelief and confusion when they heard the news: Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was to be sealed off. The announcement in the early hours of Jan 23 came as officials sought to control the outbreak of a pneumonia-like disease, then still weeks away from being given its official name, COVID-19. "My first thought was, how is that possible? How do you lock a city in?" Mr Joshua Koh told CNA at his home in Wuhan. "There’s a sense of like, what’s going to happen next? The fear of whether everybody is safe." Mr Koh and his wife, Ms Kay Lin Lee, said they knew many people who had driven out of the city before the lockdown took effect eight hours after the initial announcement at 2am. The Singaporean couple, who have four sons - aged four to 17 - have called Wuhan home for seven years. "The question that came across our mind was: How are we going to get food? How are we going to get water, you know? How are we going to get medical care if you fall sick?" said Ms Lee. The family of six also had to make a difficult choice - whether to stay put or head back to Singapore on an evacuation flight. Mr Koh said they initially decided to stay in Wuhan to ensure operations and staff at the international school that he and his wife work for were taken care of. But as the lockdown dragged on, they made the call to get on the second evacuation flight back to Singapore in February. "That's the heart-wrenching moment when you may decide that you would leave and you know that not everybody will leave. Some will be left behind, and more importantly, the national (local) staff cannot leave," said Mr Koh. "So that sense of abandoning them is there. It's real and it's a torture, I think it left a scar in me." Ms Lee said the family did not want to burden Wuhan’s already taxed health system if they had stayed and fallen ill, one of the factors that sealed their decision to return to Singapore. The couple also recalled conversations they had with the local staff they were close to. "Although they were unwilling ... they said: Please go back, you have four kids, you need to look after your kids, we are fine. It's safer for you to be back," recalled Mr Koh. There were also concerns about getting to the airport and making it through the night. "The queue to go in was really long … and there were actually a lot of people at the airport all on evacuation flights, and so the risk was there," said Ms Lee. "But I guess all these concerns, by the time we touched down in Singapore - it was like a relief." What they thought would be a one month stay turned into a long eight months back in Singapore. But the family said this was by no means a holiday as work and school continued remotely. The family also volunteered their time, distributing hand sanitiser and packing goodie bags for foreign workers. It would not be until October that the Kohs were finally able to come back to Wuhan. "Life has returned back to normal. But you know, that's not true because you can sense that there's something that has changed," said Mr Koh, pointing to the prevalence of people wearing masks and the businesses that shut down in the time the family were away. Now they try to avoid crowded places like malls during the weekends and spend more time at home or at open spaces like parks. For now, they consider Wuhan home. Given the constantly changing travel restrictions, they are not sure when they will return to Singapore. For 42-year-old Mdm Jin, 2020 is a year she would rather forget. The Wuhan resident, who asked that her identity not be revealed, had tested positive for COVID-19 in January after she returned to her hometown in neighbouring Henan province to celebrate the Spring Festival. Her symptoms were mild and her biggest concern was whether she had unknowingly infected her son and elderly parents. "I definitely was feeling very down but then I also thought to myself that I wouldn't be so unlucky to die, although I already prepared myself for that," said Mdm Jin. "As long as my son and parents were all right, nothing else mattered." Her concerns were thankfully unfounded but little did she expect that her challenges would continue even after being discharged from hospital. She recalled facing objections from neighbours and even relatives when she tried to return to her parents' home in Henan and was forced to stay in a hotel instead. "(My parents) really begged them, they wanted me to go back," said Mdm Jin. "They said: My daughter is already well, she has all the hospital reports and they are normal, why won't you let her come back?" Now, almost a year on, Mdm Jin is back in Wuhan where she continues to work. She still faces lingering health issues, like loss of stamina. But it's the emotional wounds, she said, that are harder to overcome. She is not sure if she will return to her hometown again during the Spring Festival in February next year. And should there be a resurgence of cases, she is worried about getting infected with the coronavirus again. "I try to forget this as much as possible and try not to think about it, but it's not possible," said Mdm Jin. The latest reminder of the long-term impact of the virus was when she recently tried to buy an insurance policy. Her application was rejected and she believes it was because she had declared she was once COVID-19 positive. "It was then that I realised it really does have a big impact on us," she said. During her stay in hospital, Mdm Jin said she was resentful and questioned why Chinese authorities had not heeded early warnings or taken the matter seriously from the start. "There are some things where the damage that has been caused cannot be reversed, but we can only hope to do better," she said. But she was also careful to temper her criticism with some praise. "I think what the government has done after that has been pretty good. People should recognise that." The 76-day lockdown in Wuhan remains a vivid memory for many, including actor Li Jinglun and his colleagues, who volunteered their time manning an exit and entry point at a community in the city. "When we pass by the road occasionally, we will point at it and say we will never come back here again," said Mr Li with a laugh. "It was very tough, no one wants to go through something like that again." The last time CNA spoke to Mr Li was when he had just completed his last volunteer shift as Wuhan emerged out of lockdown on Apr 8. "There have been big changes," he said. "My daughter has gone back to school, work has resumed, and we have started performances and rehearsals." The theatre is only allowed to operate at 75 per cent capacity and other safe distancing precautions are in place. Mr Li said his theatre group was still discussing how to translate their experiences to the stage. "As an actor and creator, we have constraints we give ourselves to try and convey the positive as much as possible. Focusing too much on the negative isn't good," said Mr Li. Elsewhere in Wuhan, the official narrative is also being carefully crafted. An exhibition hall that was converted into a temporary hospital for COVID-19 patients now houses a showcase of China’s success in taming the pandemic. Apart from praising the efforts of the country's leaders and medical workers, the exhibition also pays tribute to those who died in the process. One of them is Li Wenliang, the doctor who was one of the first to sound the alarm about a then unknown SARS-like virus but later reprimanded by police for spreading false information. His death sparked public outrage in what was perceived to be a cover-up by authorities in the early stages of the outbreak. 
Europe launches massive Covid-19 vaccination drive | "Thank God," 96-year-old Ms Araceli Hidalgo said as she became the first person in Spain to receive a vaccine. She told the staff at her care home near Madrid she had not felt a thing. "Let's see if we can make this virus go away," she said. In Italy, the first country in Europe to record significant numbers of infections, 29-year-old nurse Claudia Alivernini was one of three medical workers at the head of the queue for the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.

With surveys pointing to high levels of hesitancy towards the vaccine in countries such as France and Poland, leaders of the 27-country European Union are promoting it as the best chance of getting back to something like normal life next year. Meanwhile, the vaccine developed by the British drug group AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has achieved a "winning formula" for efficacy, the company's chief executive said yesterday. The vaccine, currently being evaluated by Britain's independent medicine regulator, provides "100 per cent protection" against severe Covid disease requiring hospitalisation, Mr Pascal Soriot told the Sunday Times newspaper. He believes trials will show his company has achieved a vaccine efficacy equal to Pfizer-BioNTech at 95 per cent and Moderna at 94.5 per cent.
Covid-19 pandemic will not be the last: WHO chief | Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also condemned the "dangerously short-sighted" cycle of throwing cash at outbreaks but doing nothing to prepare for the next one, in a video message marking yesterday's first International Day of Epidemic Preparedness. The WHO director-general said it was time to learn the lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic. "For too long, the world has operated on a cycle of panic and neglect," he said. "We throw money at an outbreak, and when it's over, we forget about it and do nothing to prevent the next one. This is dangerously short-sighted, and frankly difficult to understand." The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board's September 2019 first annual report on world readiness for health emergencies - published a few months before the coronavirus broke out - said the planet was woefully unprepared for potentially devastating pandemics. "History tells us this will not be the last pandemic, and epidemics are a fact of life," said Dr Tedros. "The pandemic has highlighted the intimate links between the health of humans, animals and planet. "Any efforts to improve human health are doomed unless they address the critical interface between humans and animals, and the existential threat of climate change that's making our earth less habitable." The virus has killed at least 1.75 million people and nearly 80 million cases have been recorded since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. "In the past 12 months, our world has been turned upside-down. "The impacts of the pandemic go far beyond the disease itself, with far-reaching consequences for societies and economies," said Dr Tedros. But the Ethiopian former health minister said the coronavirus crisis should not have come as a surprise, given the repeated warnings. Dr Tedros said all countries should invest in preparedness capacities to prevent, detect and mitigate emergencies of all kinds, and called for stronger primary healthcare provision. 
Sonia Chew dropped as host of countdown show amid Covid-19 probe | In a statement to The New Paper yesterday, a Mediacorp spokesman confirmed that Jean Danker will be hosting Let's Celebrate 2021 instead. Ms Chew was initially slated to host the event with fellow 987FM DJ Joakim Gomez. The duo were supposed to usher in the new year on the show, which will be screened online and on Mediacorp's channels. However, Ms Chew recently found herself a subject of investigations by the Ministry of National Development (MND), after complaints were made about a photo of a large group celebrating Mediacorp artiste Jeffrey Xu's 32nd birthday. The photo was posted on Mr Xu's account on Oct 3, and shows a group of 13 people in a private residence. Ms Chew was in the picture with other celebrities, including Shane Pow and Terence Cao. Investigations are ongoing. A Mediacorp spokesman told TNP it takes the matter seriously and constantly reminds its artistes to adhere to safe management guidelines. He added that Mr Gomez will still host the event alongside Ms Danker. "Filming for Let's Celebrate 2021 was conducted in accordance with IMDA (Infocomm Media Development Authority) guidelines, which allows no more than 20 onscreen talents unmasked during production," he said. "We would like to assure you that safety remains a priority, and that safe management measures are in place for Let's Celebrate 2021." Ms Chew posted an apology on Instagram over the weekend, saying she was invited to have drinks and was not aware it was a birthday celebration. Calling it a "severe lapse of judgment" on her part, she added it has been a tough time for her family to witness how distraught she has been. The radio presenter, who turns 29 today, is also featured in campaigns linked to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). This includes the SingapoRediscovers campaign by Klook, which features her promoting heritage tours and tourism locations. When contacted, Klook declined to comment. Ms Chew was also recently involved in a campaign by Sentosa, and was featured in commercials on Mediacorp's free-to-air platforms. TNP understands the commercials featuring her have ended, and Sentosa is looking into the matter with Mediacorp.
Athletes keep rolling with the punches amid Covid-19 | Even as torrential rain forced the Rollersports Grand National Championships to a premature end yesterday, the bad weather could not dampen the spirits of a community starved of competitive action for a year. Muhammad Syafiq Tahar, winner of the roller freestyle/aggressive inline open category, was one of those affected as his event on Saturday was delayed by a day due to inclement weather at the Somerset Skate Park. But the 34-year-old did not mind. He said: "I always try to participate in every competition there is and this is also good for the sport. "It's the end of the year so understandably, the weather isn't so good. "The organisers and judges did their best, so hopefully we'll see more of such competitions." The security officer, who has been inline skating for over 20 years, amassed 70 points to finish ahead of Toby Williams and Marcus Png, who were second and third respectively on 64 points. Although seven categories were completed over the weekend, the eighth event - the freestyle scooter international open pro - was called off yesterday afternoon owing to wet weather. Scooter athlete Nadir Mahmood was lucky as he was crowned winner of the open 11 to 18 years old category right before the downpour. The 14-year-old Tanglin Trust School student topped the field with 65 points, ahead of Huang Bin Bin (62) and Ryland Counsell (61), who were second and third respectively. Competing in his first championship, Nadir said: "It feels good because I've never taken part in a competition before. "I wasn't trying to win, it was more of getting the experience of competing." While the monsoon season is not an ideal time to host outdoor events, organiser Sonia Ong felt that it was important to stage this for freestyle scooter and aggressive inline skating as there has been a dearth of events this year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The chair of the Singapore Rollersports Federation's Vision 2030 campaign said: "I sponsored this competition because these sports are underserved, underfunded and under the radar, hence it is necessary to give them a big push into the spotlight." 
Forum: Don't let guard down against Covid-19 in the midst of festivities | Today, we are entering the third phase of Singapore's reopening in its battle to control the Covid-19 pandemic. Essentially, eight persons instead of five are allowed to gather, and there are more individuals allowed at various events. There is a sense of relief and perhaps quite a bit of joy and optimism as Singaporeans enter this phase. Indeed, I am grateful that after many months, there seems to be some semblance of control over the viral situation; however, Singaporeans need to be mindful that it is not all over. The easing of restrictions will mean that more individuals are interacting and, in the spirit of celebration, there may be loud verbal communication, laughter and even closer contact with one another. I am concerned that people will let their guard down in the midst of the festivities. The disciplined wearing of masks and social distancing have contributed greatly in controlling the spread of the virus. Incidentally, the number of cases of influenza and other respiratory illnesses has fallen during this period (which traditionally yields an increased number of such illnesses), and this is likely due to the wearing of masks and social distancing. As we enter phase three, Singaporeans must not relax these precautions, thinking that they are no longer necessary. In fact, even after this pandemic has passed, people with respiratory illnesses should take upon themselves the task of wearing masks while ill. Mass vaccination against the virus will be implemented next year. This is a necessary weapon against the spread of the virus. All should receive the vaccination, when offered, except those who are advised against it on medical grounds, those under 16 and pregnant women (because of insufficient data on safety for the latter two groups of individuals). It will, however, take some time to vaccinate about five million people, and it also takes some weeks for those vaccinated to acquire immunity. Hence, the wearing of masks and social distancing must still be practised, and eased only when a majority of the population has been vaccinated. There ought to be vigilance in the midst of thankfulness, for Singapore is battling against a global pandemic, which is not just a tiny problem that will go away on its own.
